Hello Charlie! Great..."""

""Avoid the unknown"" is ringing in your head... She has a fear of love, accepting everything but what she really dreamed of. She keeps her heart locked; no she won't ever answer even though she hears a knock. But love is at the door, and after all isn't that what we are here for? I want to rescue her, but I've already tried, for there is only one cure. (She has a fear of heights, the way you feel when you're leaving on your first flight)...

This distance in my voice  Isn`t leaving you a choice  So if you`re looking for a time to run away...  You won`t find it here  Look another way  You won`t find it here  So try another day  They took picture of our dreams  Ran to hide behind the stairs  And said maybe when it`s right  for you, they`ll fall  But if they don`t come down  Resist to need to pull them in  And throw them away  Better to save the mystery  Than surrender to the secret  You won`t find it here  Look another way  You won`t find it here  So try another day"

I keep on dreaming dreams of tomorrow Feel I'm wasting my time Lighting candles in the wind. Always taking my chances On the promise of the future But, a heart full of sorrow Paints a lonely tapestry.  The sun is shining Oh, but, it's raining in my heart.  No one understands the heartache, No one feels the pain, 'Cos no one ever sees the tears When you're crying in the rain, When you're crying in the rain, Crying in the rain.  I can never deny All the sweet things I have tasted, Tho' I've been mistreated I keep coming back for more, more, more. I know where I'm going There's no hope of absolution, I can't seem to separate The good times from the bad.  The sun is shining Oh baby, it's still raining in my heart, in my heart.  No one understands the heartache, No one feels the pain, No one ever sees the tears When you're crying in the rain, When you're crying in the rain, When you're crying in the rain, When you're crying in the rain, no, no, no.

There's no White Warrior on our side, there are no chances to survive We have just opened the Last Gate.  Not a Knight but just an evil disciple. Not so White but Black as much as Belzebu. Run because it's coming Belzebu  He made a pact for vanity, searching the glory just for him, this what is hidden in the Gate. So...  I scream for more, to change this day, but now my time has come and gone, and we can't win the game. I scream for more, to stop this fall, but now the evil seats so close and we can't free our soul, so I scream alone.  We have fought in a battle with nothing to win, and White Warrior, our Symbol, was only a dream. Now the path that we are walking might lead to nowhere, Only time can tell.  Fantasy, is just a word to fall in love. Agony is what today affects our soul.  Now we will sing so loud this song, but we don't know what we look for, Making a step beyond the Gate. So..."

Because days come and go But my feelings for you are forever  Sitting by the fire on a lonely night Hanging over from another good time With another girl... little dirty girl You should listen to this story of a life  You're my heroin- In this moment I'm lonely fullfilling my darkest dreams All these drugs, all these women I'm never forgiving... this broken heart of mine  One last kiss Before I go Dry your tears It is time to let you go  One last kiss."

Everything is all right."" I close my eyes, Then I drift away Into the magic night. I softly say A silent prayer Like dreamers do. Then I fall asleep to dream My dreams of you. In dreams I walk with you. In dreams I talk to you. In dreams you're mine. All of the time we're together In dreams, In dreams. But just before the dawn, I awake and find you gone. I can't help it, I can't help it, if I cry. I remember that you said goodbye. It's too bad that all these things, Can only happen in my dreams Only in dreams In beautiful dreams."

Forty years ago, the man proclaimed the age of the gross to be upon us and even though the man was destroying our heritage and insulting our intelligence that era has become very real. We labor for pleasure and abhor the guilt of pressure. My generation will go down as the architects of contemporary disgust. Some have fought and died. Others have allowed the strong to be butchered for a price they themselves don't care about and will never understand. I myself am beleaguered by the selfish face of a kind of man that is not mankind. Distrust in information. Fundamentalism of opinion. Catastrophic boredom, and a fanatical devotion to that which does not matter. Where is your glory now, people Where are your gods and politicians Where is your shame and salvation You rage for no reason because you have no reason. What have you ever fought for What have you ever bled for The face of the Earth is scarred with the walking dead. The age of the gross is a living virus. This is the future you have created. This is the world you have set ablaze. All your lies are coming true. All freedom is lost. All hope is gone"
