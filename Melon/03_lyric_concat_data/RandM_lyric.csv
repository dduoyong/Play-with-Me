  Pink Floyd  ,High Hopes (Radio Edit),"Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young In a world of magnets and miracles Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary The ringing of the division bell had begun Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway Do they still meet there by the Cut There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps Running before time took our dreams away Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground To a life consumed by slow decay  [Chorus] The grass was greener The light was brighter With friends surrounded The nights of wonder  [Verse 2] Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again Dragged by the force of some inner tide At a higher altitude with flag unfurled We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world  [Instrumental]  [Verse 3] Encumbered forever by desire and ambition There's a hunger still unsatisfied Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon Though down this road we've been so many times  [Chorus] The grass was greener The light was brighter The taste was sweeter The nights of wonder With friends surrounded The dawn mist glowing The water flowing The endless river For ever and ever  [Instrumental]  [Outro] ""Is that Charlie? Hello Charlie! Great..."""
  Run River North  ,Fight To Keep,I left my heart on the top of a window sill Fell apart when the winds pulled it down On the ground where sun drove the colors deep In the summer heat the colors seem to drown X2 But you pulled up the colors with a simple tune You breath a song and you dusted off the sand You put the pieces on your sleeve Oh you gave my heart to me You look so pretty that I fell upon my knees X2 The ground I saw your face You spoke of love oh you sang of grace But come the night when the light is gone It's in the dark that my deeds are done What I've done in darkness I must turn away This mangled heart is meant for so much more Though the wind it's telling me that it's ok I'll stand my ground till I hear the kingdom come X2 So I will fight to keep the fire burning in the night For I found words to keep me still Oh I'm prone to go and make the same mistakes I hear your voice calling out my name From the ground I saw your face You spoke of love oh you sang of grace But come the night when the light is gone It's in the dark that my deeds are done X2 I will fight to keep the fire burning in the night X15 Fight to keep the fire burning X6

She'll endure all she can But you could make this easier on her Go to her foolish man What's the use of having pride if you don't have her? She'll endure all she can But you could make this easier on her Make this easier on her Make this easier on her Make this easier on her

  This Day And Age  ,Always Straight Ahead,"She has a fear of heights, the way you feel when you're leaving on your first flight. She's like a sinking stone, fading from the surface, but we are never alone. She's on a tightrope, losing balance, yet something's pulling her towards hope. I want to run to her, but I've already played that card, so I will fight the urge. Eyes closed, fingers crossed; praying that she's lost... You'll never know what's around the bend. ""Avoid the unknown"" is ringing in your head... She has a fear of love, accepting everything but what she really dreamed of. She keeps her heart locked; no she won't ever answer even though she hears a knock. But love is at the door, and after all isn't that what we are here for? I want to rescue her, but I've already tried, for there is only one cure. (She has a fear of heights, the way you feel when you're leaving on your first flight)... While you rest inside your regret, the sun rises and   sets again... You're in your way, that's why you'll always be the same."

You will remember when this is blown over 이 시련이 지나고 나면 당신은 기억할 꺼에요.  And everythin's all by the way When I grow older 나이가 들어서도 I will be there at your side 난 당신 곁에 있겠어요. To remind you how I still love you 내가 어떻게 당신을 여태 사랑하고 있었는지 당신에게 일깨워 주기 위해서요.. I still love you 여전히 당신을 사랑하고 있을거에요.  Hurry back, hurry back 돌아와요...빨리 돌아와요..

  John Mayer  ,Bold As Love,Anger he smiles towering in shiny metallic purple armor Queen Jealousy envy waits behind him Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted They quietly understand The once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready But wonder why the fight is on But they're all bold as love Yeah they're all bold as love They're all bold as love Just ask the axis My red is so confident that he flashes Trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria Orange is young full of daring But very unsteady for the first go round My yellow in this case is not so mellow In fact I'm trying to say it's frightened like me And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from Giving my life to a rainbow like you I'm bold bold as love Yeah I'm bold bold as love I'm bold bold as love Just ask the axis Yeah he knows he knows he knows he knows everything I'm bold bold as love I'm bold bold as love I'm bold bold as love

Do you wish you were somewhere else?  Justified all the things you tried,  said that it was all for me    And be near,  Just for the moment,  Stay here,  Never go home    Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?  So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true,  It comes true    Have you learned all the secrets yet?  Were you burn by the things I've said?  Took the dive just to feel alive,  but never heard the truth    Now I'm in love but I don't know how  I'm in pain cause I want it now  As I sit watching her eyes close,  I slowly open mine    And be near,  Just for the moment,  Stay here,  Never go home    Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?  So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true, comes true    I am so confused by this.  I know that life is hit or miss  Days are stung by too much sun,  I think that you may be the one    Cover yourself up in me,  Shrouded in what could have been  I will listen to your pain,  if you listen to me    Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?  So it goes, as the story of a broken heart comes true,  Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?

  Quella Vecchia Locanda  ,Villa Doria Pamphili,"Scender sulla terra, Quando intrisa di rugiada, Puoi porgere le mani verso lei. Aspettar che il vento Porti giù tutte le stelle E circondar quel cuore che le attende. Scricchiolar le foglie, Confondersi nell'aria, Tra i gemiti di un canto nascerà.  Dolce l'armonia, Con la natura gioca, Si innalza per poi scivolar sui prati. Vibra in noi la gioia Per l'attimo ineguale, In quel fragore tutta la sua gloria. Grido mi risponde, Volando su quell'ala E in tuffo tu il tuo nido mi aprirai."

  Ben Folds  ,Songs Of Love,"Pale, pubescent beasts, roam through the streets  And coffee-shops, their prey gather in herds  Of stiff knee-length skirts, and white ankle-socks  But while they search for a mate, my type hibernate  In bedrooms above, composing their songs of love    Young, uniform minds, in uniform lines  And uniform ties, run round with trousers on fire  And signs of desire, they cannot disguise,  While I try to find words, as light as the birds  That circle above, to put in my songs of love    Fate doesn`t hang, on a wrong or right choice  Fortune depends, on the tone of your voice  So sing while you have time, let the sun shine down from above  And fill you with songs of love    Fate doesn`t hang, on a wrong or right choice  Fortune depends, on the tone of your voice  So let`s sing while we still can, while the sun hangs high up above  Wonderful songs of love, beautiful songs of love"

No man's bolder than Pharoahe, when he jams, your plan's over I inflict sclerosis, the most ferocious When I spy, my third eye's extremely high voltage  That's why I need ruby quartz glasses 'Cause when I glance there's a chance that I might blast the masses Subliminals, transmitted through piano Integrated in flow, calculated in nano  I use skills when I need, please heed the rhyme I heal When I bleed when I proceed through time I walk through walls and inanimate obstacles By inducing a reduction of cells and molecules  I bring the knowledge, you swallow a steak, that's a hologram I boxed your head, fattened your lip like Collagen A telepath, deliver verses with no postage Pharoahe Monch, Mike Shinoda, we high voltage  [Chorus: Mike Shinoda] High voltage (This is the unforgettable sound) High voltage (Bringing you up and taking you down) High voltage (Coming at you from every side) High voltage (Making the rhythm and rhyme collide)  High voltage (This is the unforgettable sound) High voltage (Bringing you up and taking you down) High voltage (Coming at you from every side) High voltage (Making the rhythm and rhyme collide)  [Outro: Grand Puba] Think of many episodes I swung in Lincoln Park"
  My Chemical Romance  ,Cancer,Turn away If you could get me a drink Of water cause my lips are chapped and faded Call my aunt Marie Help her gather all my things And bury me in all my favorite colors My sisters and my brothers still I will not kiss you Cause the hardest part of this Is leaving you Now turn away Cause I'm awful just to see Cause all my hair's abandoned all my body Oh my agony Know that I will never marry Baby I'm just soggy from the chemo But counting down the days to go It just ain't livin' And I just hope you know That if you say Good bye today I'd ask you to be true Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you

Just show me your broken bones, yeah you're fine Just show me your broken bones and I'll show you mine.  I know damn well we're both alright But I close my eyes everytime.

Just show me your broken bones, yeah you're fine Just show me your broken bones and I'll show you mine.  Be happy with your broken bones, And with my apocalyptic overtones You'll be fine."

This distance in my voice  Isn`t leaving you a choice  So if you`re looking for a time to run away...  You won`t find it here  Look another way  You won`t find it here  So try another day  They took picture of our dreams  Ran to hide behind the stairs  And said maybe when it`s right  for you, they`ll fall  But if they don`t come down  Resist to need to pull them in  And throw them away  Better to save the mystery  Than surrender to the secret  You won`t find it here  Look another way  You won`t find it here  So try another day"

  Whitesnake  ,Crying In The Rain,"A black cat moans When he's burning with the fever, A stray dog howls When he's lonely in the night, A woman goes crazy With the though of retribution But, a man starts weeping When he's sick and tired of life.  I keep on dreaming dreams of tomorrow Feel I'm wasting my time Lighting candles in the wind. Always taking my chances On the promise of the future But, a heart full of sorrow Paints a lonely tapestry.  The sun is shining Oh, but, it's raining in my heart.  No one understands the heartache, No one feels the pain, 'Cos no one ever sees the tears When you're crying in the rain, When you're crying in the rain, Crying in the rain.  I can never deny All the sweet things I have tasted, Tho' I've been mistreated I keep coming back for more, more, more. I know where I'm going There's no hope of absolution, I can't seem to separate The good times from the bad.  The sun is shining Oh baby, it's still raining in my heart, in my heart.  No one understands the heartache, No one feels the pain, No one ever sees the tears When you're crying in the rain, When you're crying in the rain, When you're crying in the rain, When you're crying in the rain, no, no, no.  (Solo)  The sun is shining But, it's raining in my heart.  No one understands the heartache, No one feels the pain, No one ever sees the tears When you're crying in the rain...  Crying in the rain, Crying in the rain."

  Skylark  ,The Scream,"Fantasy, is just a word to fall in love. Agony is what today affects our soul.  There's no White Warrior on our side, there are no chances to survive We have just opened the Last Gate.  Not a Knight but just an evil disciple. Not so White but Black as much as Belzebu. Run because it's coming Belzebu  He made a pact for vanity, searching the glory just for him, this what is hidden in the Gate. So...  I scream for more, to change this day, but now my time has come and gone, and we can't win the game. I scream for more, to stop this fall, but now the evil seats so close and we can't free our soul, so I scream alone.  We have fought in a battle with nothing to win, and White Warrior, our Symbol, was only a dream. Now the path that we are walking might lead to nowhere, Only time can tell.  Fantasy, is just a word to fall in love. Agony is what today affects our soul.  Now we will sing so loud this song, but we don't know what we look for, Making a step beyond the Gate. So..."

Because days come and go But my feelings for you are forever  Sitting by the fire on a lonely night Hanging over from another good time With another girl... little dirty girl You should listen to this story of a life  You're my heroin- In this moment I'm lonely fullfilling my darkest dreams All these drugs, all these women I'm never forgiving... this broken heart of mine  One last kiss Before I go Dry your tears It is time to let you go  One last kiss."

This shit will never wash off Give yourself a medal, I swear, I fucking give up We're nothing special, just an accidental tweak of the freak An evolution of the kennel in the fetish you seek There's still a part of me that’s dying in a dumpster The one who rose is a motherfucking monster  [Pre-Chorus 2] I’ve seen the future and it's simply burning I wasn’t put here to be so discerning You want the world to be dissatisfied You don't care, so why the fuck should I? Fuck, should I sell myself to stay alive?  [Chorus] I am not the same You never had a clue or knew my name You wanna know the story? Take my pain I am ready, the lie is heard I am not the same You never had intent to keep my blame You really wanna know who the fuck I am? I am the orphan The one who kills The one who killed your world  [Bridge] Everyone has something Someone here has everything Everyone has something Someone here has everything Everyone has something Someone here has everything Everyone has something Someone here has everything Everyone has something Someone here has everything Everyone has something Someone here has everything  [Verse 3] Tell me all about it, I love to hear it The way I ruin everything I touch I never thought I'd get to say I'm sorry But then again I think you ask too much Too white to be black, too black to be blue Too sick to be me, too fucked to be you I only wonder if I’ll live to see the end of the road It always gets me nowhere  [Chorus] I am not the same You never had a clue or knew my name You wanna know the story? Take my pain I am ready, the lie is heard I am not the same You never had intent to keep my blame You really wanna know who the fuck I am? I am the orphan The one who killed your world  [Outro] Everyone has something Someone here has everything I am the orphan The one who kills Everyone has something Someone here has everything I am the orphan The one who kills Yeah"

  Roy Orbison  ,In Dreams,"A candy-colored clown they call the sandman Tiptoes to my room every night Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper ""Go to sleep. Everything is all right."" I close my eyes, Then I drift away Into the magic night. I softly say A silent prayer Like dreamers do. Then I fall asleep to dream My dreams of you. In dreams I walk with you. In dreams I talk to you. In dreams you're mine. All of the time we're together In dreams, In dreams. But just before the dawn, I awake and find you gone. I can't help it, I can't help it, if I cry. I remember that you said goodbye. It's too bad that all these things, Can only happen in my dreams Only in dreams In beautiful dreams."

  Slipknot  ,.execute.,"It appears that we have reached the edge that zenith where stimuli and comatose collide. Forty years ago, the man proclaimed the age of the gross to be upon us and even though the man was destroying our heritage and insulting our intelligence that era has become very real. We labor for pleasure and abhor the guilt of pressure. My generation will go down as the architects of contemporary disgust. Some have fought and died. Others have allowed the strong to be butchered for a price they themselves don't care about and will never understand. I myself am beleaguered by the selfish face of a kind of man that is not mankind. Distrust in information. Fundamentalism of opinion. Catastrophic boredom, and a fanatical devotion to that which does not matter. Where is your glory now, people Where are your gods and politicians Where is your shame and salvation You rage for no reason because you have no reason. What have you ever fought for What have you ever bled for The face of the Earth is scarred with the walking dead. The age of the gross is a living virus. This is the future you have created. This is the world you have set ablaze. All your lies are coming true. All freedom is lost. All hope is gone"

The waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies Turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind Non-rising body from the grave showing new reality What I am, what I want, I'm only after death"

We will survive  Stand and fight! Join the light! Into the battle with power and might Sound the guns! Raise the cannons of war  With the north star to guide us We ride on the sky Blazing up through the heavens Like eagles we fly And the horsemen shall come They will judge all your lives Revelations will now be unveiled  Darkened night set to swallow the light All is lost there's no one left to fight Overpowered by the glory and might Of the ones who stand tall  Fallen heroes scattered around Deafened ears opens up to the sound Painful cries rising forever more From the victims of life and of war  Through the dark night and through the rain Fighting machine we are risen again Striving forever more... We will survive!  Stand and fight! Join the light! Into the battle with power and might Sound the guns! Raise the cannons of war  With the north star to guide us...  No more hope of freedom Our dreams are washed away The second age is coming It's the dawn of a new day Judgement stands before us The second king will rise  Our swords will shine with honour Hatred fills the sky...

  De De Lind  ,Paura Del Niente,Ho visto per la strada sporca di coriandoli un ragazzino in maschera dal portamento serio e sopra una panchina confuso fra la folla un vecchio che pareva scolpito nella pietra  Passava un carro bianco vicino a casa mia e nel silenzio greve un lungo scalpiccio. Da lunghe ciminiere si alzava un fumo nero un cane si aggirava in cerca di un padrone  Vorrei proprio incontrarti prima che il sole muoia Su un altro giorno ancora Su un altro giorno ancora.

At night when I close my eyes,  I can hear him pounding on my heart.  And my Marc Jacobs shirt  will never be white again.  Come take my soul, it was never mine  to begin with so just take it and move along.  Come take my soul, it was never mine  to begin with so just take it and leave me alone.  I can give you love and be the sweetest boy around.  But I know that in the end,  I will only bring you heartache and pain.  And I don't know how I can kill him.  Cause as much as I hate and fear him,  I love the Way he makes me sparkle and shine.  Come take my soul, it was never mine  to begin with so just take it and move along.  Come take my soul, it was never mine  to begin with so just take it and leave me alone.  Come take my soul, it was never mine  to begin with so just take it and move along.

  James Taylor  ,Sunny Skies ,"Sunny skies sleeps in the morning, he doesn't know when to rise. He closes his weary eyes upon the day, look at him yawning, throwing his morning hours away. He knows how to ease down slowly, everything is fine in the end. And you will be pleased to know that sunny skies hasn't a friend.  Sunny skies weeps in the evening, it doesn't much matter why. I guess he just has to cry from time to time, everyone's leaving, sunny skies has to stay behind.  Still he knows how to ease down slowly, everything is fine in the end. And you will be pleased to know that sunny skies hasn't a friend.  Sunny skies sleeps in the morning, he doesn't know when to rise. He closes his weary eyes upon the day and throws it all away.  Looking at the snow and trees that grow outside my window, looking at the things that pass me by. Wondering if where I've been is worth the things I've been through, ending with a friend named sunny skies."

  Don McLean  ,Winterwood,"No-one can take your place with me, And time has proven that I'm right. There's no place I'd rather be, Than at your place for the night.  No time can pass your sight unseen. No moment steals away unfound. Lifetime lived in such a dream, Floats like a feather to the ground.  (Chorus) And for the first time I've been seeing The things I'd never notice, without you. And for the first time I'm discovering The things I use to treasure, about you.  The birds like leaves on Winterwood, Sing hopeful songs on dismal days. They've learned to live life as they should. They are at peace with natures ways.  You are as natural as the night, And all that springs from you is good. And the children born beneath your light, Are like the birds on Winterwood.  (Chorus)"
  Lamb Of God  ,Terminally Unique,"There's nothing new under the gun Cognitive dissonance Wallow in sardonic fear while your will breaks like glass Throw on the blinders, ignore the signs Sink ever deeper, swallow the lie. How far did you think that you could run? You crossed the last meridian As life passes you by. Outside the fishbowl looking in Clarity to bear witness Oblivious and obstinate And you're a fucking mess. Seal all the exits, tie your own hands Burn all the bridges, head in the sand. How far did you think that you could run? You crossed the last meridian And it's all coming down now as the clock ticks on Your life is passing by. Awaken. Singing the same tired old song Predictable and somnambulant Suffering from terminal uniqueness When will you awaken? Your life is passing by."

I hear you calling from the other side I hear you calling from the other side  Sail away, my little sister Sail away to the other side Sail away, my little sister Sail away far into the night Where times seems much better Than this void called life  I hear you calling from the other side  Sail away, my little sister Sail away to the other side Sail away, my little sister Sail away far into the night Where time seems much better Than this void called life"

  Erlend Oye  ,Prego Amore ,"I was looking for a woman to be good to me. I was with the other people and they had to eat. I couldn't go alone, I didn't know my way. Don't know the language, so I had to stay. Woke up in the morning with a job to do. Twenty seconds later got stuck in the queue. When in Rome they're digging to extend the lines, they're running into ruins, gotta stop all the time. Went upon a hill to get a view of the town, didn't really happen 'cause the clouds were down. Brought a CD player to be checking our song, didn't do recordables we moved along to an elevated garden overlooking the street. She was standing with a spinett at the side of her feet. Shouted to her promising to make her a star. She didn't have the time and she left in a car. Prego amore vieni con me. Waiting for a DJ, but he never turned up. Figured that he didn't 'cause he knew he would suck. I was sitting in the rhythm backing the beat. Couldn't see her dancing back on the street. Just because you got the magic happening then doesn't make it certain it'll happen again. Just because you know someone is looking for you doesn't have a say in who they're running into"

Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth, None of them along the line know what any of it is worth.""  ""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke, ""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke. But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate, So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late.""

Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl, Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl"

  Al Stewart  ,A Man For All Seasons,"What if you reached the age of reason Only to find there was no reprieve Would you still be a man for all seasons Or would you just have to leave We measure our days out In steps of uncertainty Not turning to see how we've come And peer down the highway From here to eternity And reach out for love on the run While the man for all seasons Is lost behind the sun Henry Plantagenent still looks for someone To bring good news in his hour of doubt While Thomas More waits in the Tower of London Watching the sands running out And measures the hours out From here to oblivion In actions that can't be undone A sailor through the darkness He scans the meridian And caught by the first rays of dawn The man for all seasons Is lost beneath the storm And I should know by now I should know by now I hear them call it out all around Oh, they go There's nothing to believe in Hear them Just daydreams, deceiving They'll just let you down So what if you reached the age of reason Only to find there was no reprieve Would you still be a man for all seasons Or would you just disbelieve We measure our gains out in luck and coincidence Lanterns to turn back in the night And put our defeats down to chance or experience And try once again for the light Some wait for the waters of fortune to cover them Some just see the tides of ill chance rushing over them Some call on Jehovah Some cry out to Allah Some wait for the boats that still row to Valhallah Well, you try to accept what the fades are unfolding While some say they're sure where the shame should be falling You look round for maybe a chance of forestalling But too soon it's over and done And the man for all seasons Is lost behind the sun"

The sea was red and the sky was grey, wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today. The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake as the children of the sun began to awake. Seems that the wrath of the Gods Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow I think I might be sinking. Throw me a line if I reach it in time I'll meet you up there where the path Runs straight and high. - 연 주 중 - To find a queen without a king, They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born. Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams, Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems."

And I would sell out my pride when everybody wanna say, ""You never gave a damn 'bout your boys in the first place."" Old Dena raised me. And the road will never change me!  Hooligans Got big hearts but they're just some kids Cali made, flashy sins. Need nobody 'cause we know where we fit in.  To everyone who stuck around, this one's for you.

Need nobody 'cause we know where we fit in."

  Leonard Cohen  ,Nancy,"It seems so long ago,  Nancy was alone,  looking ate the Late Late show  through a semi-precious stone.  In the House of Honesty  her father was on trial,  in the House of Mystery  there was no one at all,  there was no one at all.    It seems so long ago,  none of us were strong;  Nancy wore green stockings  and she slept with everyone.  She never said she'd wait for us  although she was alone,  I think she fell in love for us  in nineteen sixty one,  in nineteen sixty one.    It seems so long ago,  Nancy was alone,  a forty five beside her head,  an open telephone.  We told her she was beautiful,  we told her she was free  but none of us would meet her in  the House of Mystery,  the House of Mystery.    And now you look around you,  see her everywhere,  many use her body,  many comb her hair.  In the hollow of the night  when you are cold and numb  you hear her talking freely then,  she's happy that you've come,  she's happy that you've come."

  Shinedown  ,How Did You Love (Acoustic),"You can have the sound of a thousand voices calling your name You can have the light of the world blind you, bathe you in grace But I don't see so easily what you hold in your hands Cause castles crumble, kingdoms fall and turn into sand  You can be an angel of mercy or give into hate You can try to buy it just like it every other careless mistake How do you justify I'm mystified by the ways of your heart With a million lies the truth will rise to tear you apart Wooaahh  No one gets out alive, every day is do or die The one thing you leave behind Is how did you love, how did you love It's not what you believe those prayers will make you bleed But while you're on your knees How did you love, how did you love, how did you love  Nothing ever feels quite the same when you are what you dreamed And you will never look at anything the same when you see what I see How we forget ourselves, lose our way from the cradle to the grave You can't replicate or duplicate, gotta find your own way Yeahhhh  No one gets out alive, every day is do or die The one thing you leave behind Is how did you love, how did you love It's not what you believe those prayers will make you bleed But while you're on your knees How did you love, how did you love, how did you love  This ain't no cross to carry We are the judge and jury we are the judge and jury  No one gets out alive, every day is do or die The one thing you leave behind Is how did you love, how did you love It's not what you believe those prayers will make you bleed But while you're on your knees  How did you love, how did you love, how did you love  This ain't no cross to carry We are the judge and jury, we are the judge and jury  How did you love, how did you love How did you love, how did you love"
  Rush  ,Tom Sawyer,"A modern-day warrior Mean mean stride, Today's Tom Sawyer Mean mean pride. Though his mind is not for rent, Don't put him down as arrogant. His reserve, a quiet defense, Riding out the day's events. The river And what you say about his company Is what you say about society. Catch the mist, catch the myth Catch the mystery, catch the drift. The world is, the world is, Love and life are deep, Maybe as his eyes are wide. Today's Tom Sawyer, He gets high on you, And the space he invades He gets by on you. No, his mind is not for rent To any god or government. Always hopeful, yet discontent, He knows changes aren't permanent, But change is. And what you say about his company Is what you say about society. Catch the witness, catch the wit, Catch the spirit, catch the spit. The world is, the world is, Love and life are deep, Maybe as his skies are wide. Exit the warrior, Today's Tom Sawyer, He gets high on you, And the energy you trade, He gets right on to the friction of the day."

  Roger Waters  ,The Ballad Of Bill Hubbard,"[Alf Razzell:] ""Two things that have haunted me most are the days when I had to collect the paybooks; and when I left Bill Hubbard in no-man's-land. I was picked up and taken into their trench. And I'd no sooner taken two or three steps down the trench when I heard a call, 'Hello Razz, I'm glad to see you. This is my second night here,' and he said 'I'm feeling bad,' and it was Bill Hubbard, one of the men we'd trained in England, one of the original battalion. I had a look at his wound; rolled him over. I could see it was probably a fatal wound. You could imagine what pain he was in, he was dripping with sweat; and after I'd gone about three shellholes, traversed that, had it been...had there been a path or a road I could have done better. He pummelled me, 'Put me down, put me down, I'd rather die, I'd rather die, put me down.' I was hoping he would faint. He said 'I can't go any further, let me die.' I said 'If I leave you here Bill you won't be found, let's have another go.' He said 'All right then.' And the same thing happened. he couldn't stand it any more, and I had to leave him there, in no-man's-land.""  (switch channels)"

  David Bowie  ,The Width Of A Circle (2015 Remastered Ver.),"In the corner of the morning in the past I would sit and blame the master first and last All the roads were straight and narrow And the prayers were small and yellow And the rumour spread that I was aging fast Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree And I looked and frowned and the monster was me  Well, I said hello and I said hello And I asked ""Why not?"" and I replied ""I don't know."" So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be And he laughed insane and quipped ""KAHLIL GIBRAN"" So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through For I realized that God's a young man too  So I said ""So long"" and I waved ""Bye-bye"" And I smashed my soul and traded my mind Got laid by a young bordello I was vaguely half asleep For which my reputation swept back home in drag And the moral of this magic spell Negotiates my hide When God did take my logic for a ride (Riding along)  He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips And showed me the leather belt round his hips My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame He said ""You'll never go down to the Gods again"" (Turn around,go back!)  He struck the ground a cavern appeared And I smelt the burning pit of fear We crashed a thousand yards below I said ""Do it again, do it again"" (Turn around,go back!)  His nebulous body swayed above His tongue swollen with devil's love The snake and I, a venom high I said ""Do it again, do it again"" (Turn around, go back!)  Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply And I was seething, breathing deeply Spitting sentry, horned and tailed Waiting for you  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

Once I was a prisoner, I was riding in a truck, Cleaned up for public display. I looked at those around me, And when they looked at me, I let them see my soul that day.  Are you scared of it? Do you wish that it would stop? Does it bother you when you hear your spirit talk? Well I'm right with you, Yes I'm right with you. It's working on me, It's working on you. It's working on me."

  Judas Priest  ,Lochness,Grey mist drifts upon the water The mirrored surface moves Awakened of this prescence Dispelling legends proof  A beastly head of onyx With eyes set coals of fire It's leathered hide Glides glistening Ascends the heathered briar  This legend lives Through centuries Evoking history's memories Prevailing in eternities on and on and on  Lochness confess your terror of the deep Lochness distress Malingers what you keep Lochness protects monstrosity Lochness confess to me  Somehow it heeds the piper From battlements that call From side to side it ponders Impassioned in the skirl  This highland lair of mystery Retains a lost world's empathy Resiliant to discovery on and on and on  This legend lives Through centuries Evoking history's memories Prevailing in eternity Your secret lies safe with me  This creatures peril from decease Implores to mankind for release A legacy to rest in peace and on and on and on

  Ed Sheeran  ,Take It Back,"I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in I never want to get bitten Cause plagiarism is hidden Watch how I sit on the rhythm Prisoner with a vision Signs of a label But didn't listen to any criticism Thought you knew but you didn't So perk your ears up and listen Studio is a system And you could say that I'm driven And now it's onto the next saga We drink the best lager I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather I do my own thing now And get respect after And I'm avoiding the 'caine Like it was Get Carter For four years I never had a place to stay But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded Like a paper weight At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked Went from sleeping at a subway station To sleeping with a movie star And adding to the population Not my imagination I don't wanna relax Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax I take it back now  Mmmm come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love No  I take it back with the rhythm and blues With my rap pack I'll be singing the news Tryin' act like Jack Black When I bring it to school I make a beat with my feet By just hittin' the loop Bringing the lyrics to prove That I can fit in these shoes I give you the truth through the vocal booth And stars burst out on the scene Like an opal fruit They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot But then again that's what they're supposed to do And I'm supposed to be calm I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm Whispering everything that happens Is from now on I'll be ready to start again By the end of the song Since they are claiming I handled it wrong But then I've never had an enemy Except the NME but I'll be selling Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be With only spectacles ahead of me And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it This song's from the heart cover the planet I take it back now  Mmmm come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love No And take it back now  Now I don't ever wanna be perfect Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition 'Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written Now absence can make your heart ache But drinking absinth can change your mind state Vividly need to let my liver be And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me And I hope to see him blowing up globally 'Cause that how it's supposed to be I'm screaming out vocally It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams But, but I just write schemes I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of Mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down, that's how we plan it out It's time to take it back now  Mmmm come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love No  Mmm come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love No My dreams keep me awake at night Written in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype Am I just living the lie With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake But the other 10 per cent it never fades Dreaming dreams, day to day goals Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up And just remember just to hold out more A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought You'd find me buskin' on the street When it was cold outdoors And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour Writing love songs for the sake of it Never to make a hit You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses Little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is Dreams you own, just set your goals And have the utmost faith in it tread your own path You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha"

A mouth open, flies ascending A paradise of empty souls The black skies an empty ocean It took the wink of an eye For our pleasant tree of knowledge A long shadow touches death Lose sight of a broken promise And in a moment nothingness descends Cry for the man in the mirror See his empty eyes, where nothing lies beyond Cry for the man in the mirror See his empty eyes, where nothing lies beyond Cry for the man in the mirror See his empty eyes, where nothing lies beyond Cry for the man in the mirror See his empty eyes, where nothing lies beyond Cry for the man in the mirror See his empty eyes, where nothing lies beyond Cry for the man in the mirror See his empty eyes, where nothing lies beyond Cry for the man in the mirror See his empty eyes, where nothing lies beyond"""

The body bags and little rags of children torn in two And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun.

  Santana  ,Samba Pa Ti,"Samba Pa Ti is a song that I wrote when we came back from Europe the very first time. I was up in my room looking out my window because I heard this sound. This cat blew a couple of notes on the saxophone in the back of the alley.  And when I looked out, he was trying to stay up on his feet. It looked like the whole world was moving around him. And he was trying to decide between putting his saxophone in his mouth and putting the bottle of booze from his back pocket into his mouth.  And I thought ""he is a prisoner."" He didn't know what to put in his mouth next - the horn or the bottle of booze, you know. And it just hit me. It really broke me down because he looked like all of us at one time or another.  And for some reason, i just heard these lyrics, ""through every step in life you find freedom from within."" And then I heard the melody.  It was one of the first songs that I felt really free, free enough to forget about anything. You just let it flow through you. And even though it's very simple, there's still a lot of emotion in it."

  Al Stewart  ,The Palace Of Versailles,The wands of smoke are rising From the walls of the Bastille And through the streets of Paris Runs a sense of the unreal The Kings have all departed There servants are nowhere We burned out their mansions In the name of Robespierre And still we wait To see the day begin Our time is wasting in the wind Wondering why Wondering why it echoes Through the lonely palace of Versailles  Inside the midnight councils The lamps are burning low On you sit and talk all through the night But there's just no place to go And Bonaparte is coming With his army from the south Marat your days are numbered And we live hand to mouth While we wait To see the day begin Our time is wasting in the wind Wondering why Wondering why it echoes Through the lonely palace of Versailles  The ghost of revolution Still prowls the Paris streets Down all the restless centuries It wonders incomplete It speaks inside the cheap red wine Of cafe summer nights Its red and amber voices Call the cars at traffic lights Why do you wait To see the day begin Your time is wasting in the wind Wondering why Wondering why it echoes Through the lonely palace of Versailles Wondering why it echoes Through the lonely palace of Versailles

When I was in Missouri they would not let me be I had to leave there in a hurry I only saw what they let me see You broke a heart that loved you Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore I've been walkin' that lonesome valley Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door.  People on the platforms, waitin' for the trains I can hear their hearts a-beatin' Like pendulums swinging on chains When you think that you've lost everything You find out you can always lose a little more I'm just goin' down the road feeling bad Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door.  I'm goin' down the river, down to New Orleans They tell me everything is gonna be all right But I don't know what all right even means I was ridin' in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore I've been all around the world, boys And I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door.  Gonna sleep down in the parlor and relive my dreams I close my eyes and I wonder If everything is as hollow as it seems Some trains don't pull no gamblers No midnight ramblers, like they did before I've been to sugar town, I shook the sugar down Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door."
  Beirut  ,A Candle`s Fire,"Oh, light a candle's fire, it carries our good name What would you ask a campfire? It scares me just the same And you, you've had it all along An endless need for games Just don't forget, a candle's fire is only just a flame  I hit certain from afar, failed to pull my weight But you were light, we traveled through the fall To arrive at our front gate Tonight, we rest beside the fire A smile upon your face Just don't forget, a candle's fire is only just a flame  If I had known, that to carry on that way It wouldn't show in the creases on your face If you should go, would you carry on my name? Just let it blow, and the fog will ? Bishop's flame"

Can you see me lying Down on the floor Still laughing like a child? My head is full of voices My head is full of lights So please let me go Please let me run away
  Bastille  ,Pompeii (Kat Krazy Remix),"I was left to my own devices  Many days fell away with nothing to show  And the walls kept tumbling down  In the city that we love  Great clouds roll over the hills  Bringing darkness from above  But if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  Nothing changed at all?  And if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  You`ve been here before?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  We were caught up and lost in all of our vices  In your pose as the dust settles around us  And the walls kept tumbling down  In the city that we love  Great clouds roll over the hills  Bringing darkness from above  But if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  Nothing changed at all?  And if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  You`ve been here before?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  Oh where do we begin?  The rubble or our sins?  Oh where do we begin?  The rubble or our sins?  And the walls kept tumbling down  In the city that we love  Great clouds roll over the hills  Bringing darkness from above  But if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  Nothing changed at all?

And if you close your eyes,  Does it almost feel like  Nothing changed at all?"

I'm but a clean man, stable and alone man  Make it so I won't have to try  The faces always stay the same  So I face the fact that I'm just fine  I said that I'm just fine    I remember, head down,  After you had found out  Manna is a hell of a drug  And I need a little more, I think  Because enough is never quite enough  What's enough?    I took it like a grown man crying on the pavement  Hoping you would show your face  But I haven't heard a thing you've said  In at least a couple hundred days  What'd you say?    I was in the front seat, shaking it out  And I was asking if you felt alright  I never want to hear the truth  I want to hear your voice, it sounded fine  My voice, it sounded fine    I could feel my heartbeat taking me down  And for the moment, I would sleep alright  I'm ? with a selfish fear  To keep me up another restless night  Another restless night    The blood was dry, it was sober  The feeling of audible cracks  And I could tell it was over  From the curtains that hung from your neck    And I realized that then you were perfect  And my teeth ripping out of my head  And it looked like a painting I once knew  Back when my thoughts weren't entirely intact    To pray for what I thought were angels  Ended up being ambulances  And the Lord showed me dreams of my daughter  She was crying inside your stomach    And I felt love again"

  Deep Purple  ,April (Part 1),"April is a cruel time  Even though the sun may shine  And world looks in the shade as it slowly comes away  Still falls the April rain  And the valley's filled with pain  And you can't tell me quite why  As I look up to the grey sky  Where it should be blue  Grey sky where I should see you  Ask why, why it should be so  I'll cry, say that I don't know    Baby on-ce in a while I'll forget and I'll smile  But then the feeling comes again of an April without end  Of an April lonely as a girl  In the dark of my mind I can see all too fine  But there is nothing to be done when I just can't feel the sun  And the springtime's the season of the night    Grey sky where it should be blue  Grey sky where I should see you  Ask why, why it should be so  I'll cry, say that I don't know  I don't know"

  Marketa Irglova  ,We Are Good,Early morning rising with the sun Resting where the sky meets the earth Feeling the first rays of sunlight reaching into my soul Where they reinstate the sense of my own self worth If you're not good you're bad That's far too black and white Behold the glorious sun in all its radiance bright It too at times is obscured by the thick blue veil of night Still the moon and all the stars combine to reflect it's light And so it is that we are good Though we do not always do as we should We lose track of right and wrong And we're not always standing strong But still don't you wanna believe In things that eyes do not perceive Like our light shining from within That in a battle with our darkness can win The gates of heaven open up before me As my heart is given wings and flies Leaving all pretense behind everything is crystal clear Even the worry of uncertainty subsides They say that time will come for us to be reborn Into the newness of unity that has been torn Into duality into it's us against them It's from a place of fear that all our conflicts stem We're almost there but not yet still the stage is set For the play we may enact according to our contract That we may both you and I with everybody in our home up high To awaken from our deep and long undisturbed though hardly peaceful sleep If to look is to know the grace which you bestow Upon those that you would raise into a kind and loving gaze Then to look is to see everyone as good as they can be

Do you feel loved?  Love's a bully pushing shoving In the belly of a woman Heavy rhythm taking over To stick together A man and a woman Stick together Man and woman Stick together ... Do you feel loved? Do you feel loved? And it looks like the sun But it feels like the rain And there's heat in the sun To see us through the rain Do you feel loved? Do you feel loved?

  Harem Scarem  ,Honestly,"I stand before you, accused of many crimes But I want to believe that love can still survive You don？t have to say it, I don？t have to read your mind To know the emptiness that？s finally arrived  How was I, to know the right from wrong Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong ?  Tell me honestly, if you？re still loving me Looking into my eyes, honestly? Words will have more meaning, if they？re said at certain times Now the all they？ve seen I found to be a lie How would you know it, you won？t give me sometime To see if everything could work out, and you？d be mine  Oh, will love be lost forever but someday I will find The world we？ve all been searching for Or just some peace of mind..  Tell me honestly, if you？re still loving me Looking into my eyes, honestly..  All the night I sit and wonder Must be more to laugh, I？m sure that Days and years gone by while I am Living with the.. Oh, lonely feeling"

  Longpigs  ,Lost Myself,"She sold herself on the one love, the one that most of us live without, And... Dressed for the occasion Day after day. Forgives herself when it don't come.  I have always found it Easier to dream about it, Careful of the stitches, Insisted there was more than this,  And I lost myself I cannot speak, To live by myself I am far too weak. I have lost myself and I cannot sleep To live by myself I am far too weak.  Went bold as hell for the one love. The one that most of us read about. And... caressed all the persuaders Day after day Relieves herself when it don't come.  By the things you're saying Its easier to turn the blame in. Careful of the stitches Insisted there was more than this.  But I lost myself, I cannot speak. To live by myself I am far too weak. I have lost myself and I cannot sleep, To live by myself I am far too weak.  Sold again on the one love, The one that all of them scream about. She's broke her wings on the one love, Her heart's so warm but its burn she wants.  I have always found it Easier to skirt around it Careful of the stitches, She insisted there was more than this.  And I lost myself I cannot speak To live by myself I'm far too weak. I have lost myself and I cannot sleep, To live by myself I am far too weak."
