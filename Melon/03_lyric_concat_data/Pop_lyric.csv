  Patti Labelle And Her Blue Belles  ,Danny Boy,"""Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling From glen to glen, and down the mountain side. The summer's gone, and all the roses falling, It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.  But come ye back when summer's in the meadow, Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow, It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow, Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!  But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying, If I am dead, as dead I well may be, You'll come and find the place where I am lying, And kneel and say an Ave there for me. And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me, And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be, For you will bend and tell me that you love me, And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!  """

  Barbra Streisand  ,Memory,"Midnight Not a sound from the pavement 한 밤중 거리에서는 아무 소리도 들리지 않네 Has the moon lost her memory? 달님도 추억을 잃어버린 걸까? She is smiling alone 홀로 미소짓고 있네 In the lamp light the withered leaves collect at my feet 가로등의 불빛아래 시든 낙엽들이 내 발밑에 쌓이고 있어 And the wind begins to moan 게다가 바람은 '윙윙' 구슬픈 소리를 내기 시작하네  Memory, all alone in the moon light 추억을 회상하며, 달빛 아래 나 홀로 I can dream of the old days 과거의 아름답던 시절을 다시 꿈꿀 수 있지 life was beautiful then 그 때에는 삶이 무척 아름다웠는데... I remember the time I knew what happiness was 내 기억으론, 그 때에는 내가 행복이 무엇인지를 알고 있었던 것 같아. Let the memory live again 과거의 즐거웠던 그 추억, 다시 내게 돌아오라...  Every street lamp seems to beat a fatalistic warning 모든 가로등들이 곧 아침이 밝아올 것을 예시라도 하는 듯 깜빡거리며 운명적인 사인을 내보내고 있어 Someone mutters and a street lamp sputters 어떤이가 투덜거리고, 가로등이 서서히 꺼져가는 것을 보니 And soon it will be morning 곧 아침이 밝아올것 같아  Daylight I must wait for the sunrise 새벽에 해가 뜰 때까지 기다려야만해 I must think of a new life 새로운 삶을 설계해야만 하니까 And I mustn't give in 그리고 절대 포기해서는 안된다구 When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too 여명이 밝아오면 오늘밤도 역시 또 하나의 추억이 될거야 And a new day will begin 그리곤 새로운 날이 펼쳐질거야  Burnt-out ends of smoky days 연기 자욱하게 낀 암울한 날이 완전히 타들어 갈 무렵 The stale cold smell of morning 케케하고 냉랭한 아침 냄새가 느껴지고 A street lamp dies 가로등은 차츰 꺼져가네 Another night is over 또 하룻밤이 지나가고 Another day is dawning 새로운 날이 밝아오고 있어  Touch me It's so easy to leave me 절 잡아줘요 사람들은 저를 쉽게 외면하곤 한답니다 All alone with the memory of my days in the sun 과거 즐거웠던 시절을 회상하며 홀로 외로이 추억에 잠기게 하죠 If you touch me 만약 당신이 제 감정을 만질 수 있다면 You'll understand shat happiness is 행복이라는 것이 무엇인지 이해할 수 있을 거예요 Look, a new day has begun 자 보세요, 어느덧 새 날이 밝았군요"

"  Peter, Paul & Mary  ",Puff (The Magic Dragon),"Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee.

Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee.  together they would travel on a boat with billowed sails. Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail Noble kings and princess would bow when there they came. Pirate ships would lower their flads when Puff roared out his name.  Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee. Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee.  A dragon lives forever but not so little boys Painted wings and giants rings make way for other toys. One gray night it happened Jackie Paper came no more And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.  His head was bent in sorrow. Grief scales fell like rain Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane. Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave. So Puff that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave.  Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee. Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the Autumn mist in a land called Hanalee."

  Elvis Presley  ,Anything That`s Part Of You,"I memorize the note you sent 당신이 보낸 글들을 전부 기억해요 Go all the places that we went 우리가 함께 갔던곳을 돌아다녔지요. I seem to search the whole day through For anything that's part of you 난 당신의 흔적만 찾아서 하루종일 돌아 다니는것 같아요  I kept a ribbon from your hair 당신의 머리 리본을 간직 하고 있어요. A breath of perfume lingers there 아직 은은한 향수내음이 남아 있지요. It helps to cheer me when I'm blue Anything that's part of you 당신의 흔적은 내가 우울할 때 날 위로해 준답니다. 그게 사소한것 일지라도  Oh, how it hurts to miss you so When I know you don't love me.. anymore 당신이 더 이상 날 사랑하지 않음을 알면서도 당신을 그리워하는 건 너무 가슴아파요 To go on needing you 당신은 날 원하지 않음을 Knowing you don't need me 알면서도 당신을 계속 원하게 되네요.  No reason left for me to live 내겐 더이상 살아갈 이유가 없어요 What can I take, what can I give 무엇을 갖고,무엇을 주어야할까요.. When I'd give all of someone new 내가 새로운 사람에게 모든걸 준다해도 For anything that's part of you 당신의 흔적들 뿐일텐데.."

  Leona Lewis  ,Heartbeat,If I could have laid low I would be creeping round the streets Avoiding all the busy main roads And keep anounce of dignity And if I could have stayed home I would have slept through everything Turn off my phone and breathe a silence Stay in the comfort zone of me Cause nobody lies in their bed Nobody's heart gets broken Nobody cries in there but I ain't going in When I don't speak Weak and hollow heartbeats Leaking through my heart seam Body sells me out sells me out So I keep this deep and shallow heartbeat Under my control And you will never see me weak And you will never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat Oooohhh beat If I never met you I would be busy with my life Going to work and still be happy I will be sleeping through the nights And if I could forget you I would go back and look for parts For patching up my broken heart And I would shut my aching eyes Cause nobody shouts at their friends Nobody wants forgiveness Nobody doubts in there but I ain't giving in When I don't speak Weak and hollow heartbeats Leaking from my heart seam Body sells me out sells me out So I keep this deep and shallow heartbeat Under my control And you will never see me weak And you will never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat beat beat If I keep it down Just focus I'm invisible Cause when there is no sound I know where I belong I will be ok When I don't speak Weak and hollow heartbeats Leaking from my heart seam Body sells me out sells me out no no no So I keep this deep and shallow heatbeat Under my control And you will never see me weak You will never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat Never hear my heartbeat beat beat Heartbeat my heartbeat

  Various Artists  ,Khe Sanh,"I left my heart to the sappers round Khe Sanh And my soul was sold with my cigarettes to the blackmarket man I've had the Vietnam cold turkey From the ocean to the Silver City And it's only other vets could understand About the long forgotten dockside guarantees How there were no V dayheroes in 1973 How we sailed into Sydney Harbour Saw an old friend but couldn't kiss her She was lined, and I was home to the lucky land And she was like so many more from that time on Their lives were all so empty, till they found their chosen one And their legs were often open But their minds were always closed And their hearts were held in fast suburban chains And the legal pads were yellow, hours long, paypacket lean And the telex writers clattered where the gunships once had been But the car parks made me jumpy And I never stopped the dreams Or the growing need for speed and novacaine So I worked across the country end to end Tried to find a place to settle down, where my mixed up life could mend Held a job on an oil rig Flying choppers when I could But the nightlife nearly drove me round the bend And I've travelled round the world from year to year And each one found me aimless, one more year the worse for wear And I've been back to South East Asia But the answer sure ain't there But I'm drifting north, to check things out again You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone Only seven flying hours, and I'll be landing in Hong Kong There ain't nothing like the kisses From a jaded Chinese princess I'm gonna hit some Hong Kong mattress all night long Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone Yeah the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone And it's really got me worried I'm goin' nowhere and I'm in a hurry And the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone"

  Sting  ,August Winds,When August winds are turning The fishing boats set out upon the sea I watch 'til they sail out of sight The winter follows soon I watch them drawn into the night Beneath the August moon No one knows I come here Some things I don't share I can't explain the reasons why It moves me close to tears Or something in the season's change Will find me wandering here And in my public moments I hear the things I say but they're not me Perhaps I'll know before I die Admit that there's a reason why I count the boats returning to the sea I count the boats returning to the sea And in my private moments I drop the mask that I've been forced to wear But no one knows this secret me Where albeit unconsciously I count the boats returning from the sea I count the boats returning from the sea

Sometimes I see your face The stars seem to lose their place Why must I think of you? Why must I? Why should I?  Why should I cry for you? Why would you want me to? And what would it mean to say ""I loved you in my fashion""? What would be true? Why should I? Why should I cry for you?"

  George Michael  ,Praying For Time (Remastered 2006),These are the days of the open hand They will not be the last Look around now These are the days of the beggars and the choosers This is the year of the hungry man Whose place is in the past Hand in hand with ignorance And legitimate excuses The rich declare themselves poor And most of us are not sure If we have too much But we'll take our chances Because god's stopped keeping score I guess somewhere along the way He must have let us all out to play Turned his back and all god's children Crept out the back door And it's hard to love there's so much to hate Hanging on to hope When there is no hope to speak of And the wounded skies above say it's much much too late Well maybe we should all be praying for time These are the days of the empty hand Oh you hold on to what you can And charity is a coat you wear twice a year This is the year of the guilty man Your television takes a stand And you find that what was over there is over here So you scream from behind your door Say what's mine is mine and not yours I may have too much but I'll take my chances Because god's stopped keeping score And you cling to the things they sold you Did you cover your eyes when they told you That he can't come back Beacuse he has no children to come back for And it's hard to love there's so much to hate Hanging on to hope When there is no hope to speak of And the wounded skies above say it's much too late Well maybe we should all be praying for time

  Paul Revere & The Raiders  ,Indian Reservation (인디안 보호 구역),"They took the whole Cherokee Nation And put us on this reservation Took away our ways of life The tomahawk and the bow and knife Took away our native tongue And taught their English to our young And all the beads we made by hand Are nowadays made in Japan Cherokee people, Cherokee tribe So proud to live, so proud to die They took the whole Indian Nation And locked us on this reservation though I wear a shirt and tie I'm still a red man deep inside Cherokee people, Cherokee tribe So proud to live, so proud to die But maybe someday when they learn Cherokee Nation will return Will return Will return Will return Will return"
  George Michael  ,Father Figure (Remastered),I can't light no more of your darkness  All my pictures seem to fade to black and white  I'm growing tired and time stands still before me  Frozen here on the ladder of my life  It's too late to save myself from falling  I took a chance and changed your way of life  But you misread my meaning when I met you  Closed the door and left me blinded by the light Don't let the sun go down on me Although I search myself It's always someone else I see I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free  But losing everything is like the sun going down on me  I can't find on the right romantic line  but see me once and see the way I feel  Don't discard me just because you thing I mean you harm just because you thing I mean you harm But these cuts I have they need love to help them heal Don't let the sun go down on me Although I search myself It's always someone else I see I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free  But losing everything is like the sun going down on me  Don't let the sun go down on me Although I search myself It's always someone else I see I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free Baby But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

  Spice Girls  ,Christmas Wrapping,"Bah! Humbug - no, that's too strong Cos it's my favorite holiday But all this year's been a busy blur Don't think I have the energy To add to my already mad rush Just because it is the season The perfect gift for me would be Completions and connections left from Last year, world tour Aeroplanes and babies Met some guys but never the time Most of '98 passed along those lines So deck the halls and trim those trees Raise up the cups of Christmas cheer I just need to catch my breath Christmas with my mates this year  Calendar picture, frozen landscape Chilled this room for twenty-four days Evergreens, sparkling snow Get this winter over with! Flashback to springtime, saw him again Would've been good to go for lunch Couldn't agree we were both free We tried, we said we'd keep in touch We didn't, of course, 'till the summertime Out to the beach to his boat, could I join him?

But I think I'll miss this one this year Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! But I think I'll miss this one this year  Hardly dashing through the snow Cos I bundled up too tight Last minute have-to-do's A few cards, a few calls Because it's R-S-V-P No thanks, no party lights It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax Turned down all of my invites Last fall I had a night to myself Same guy called, halloween party Waited all night for him to show This time his car wouldn't go Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late Trudge on home to celebrate In a quiet way, unwind Doing Christmas right this time  Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! But I think I'll miss this one this year Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! But I think I'll miss this one this year  Tesco has provided me With the world's smallest turkey Already in the oven, nice and hot Oh damn, guess what I forgot? So it's on with the boots, back out in the snow To the only all-night garage But when to my wondering eyes should appear In the line that guy I've been chasing all year ""Spending this one alone,"" he said ""Need a break; this year's been crazy."" I said, ""Me too, but why are you? You mean you forgot the papers too?"" Then suddenly we laughed and laughed Caught on to what was happening Christmas magic's brought this tale To a very happy e-ending  Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! But I think I'll miss this one this year Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! But I think I'll miss this one this year [Repeat to Fade"

  Harry Nilsson  ,Over The Rainbow,"Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high, 저기 어딘가에, 무지개 너머에, 저 높은 곳에  There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby. 자장가에 가끔 나오는 나라가 있다고 들었어  Somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue, 저기 어딘가에, 무지개 너머에, 푸른 하늘에  And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true. 니가 감히 꿈꿔왔던 일들이 정말 현실이 되는 나라.  One(some) day I'll wish upon a star 어느날 나는 별에게 소원을 빌었어  And wake up where the clouds are far behind me. 그리고 구름 저 건너에 일어났지  Where troubles melt like lemon drops 걱정은 마치 레몬즙처럼 녹아버리고  Away above the chimney tops 굴뚝 저 높이에  That's where you'll find me. 그곳이 바로 네가 나를 찾을 곳이야.  Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly, 무지개 저 너머 어딘가에, 파랑새는 날아다니고,  Birds fly over the rainbow, 새들은 무지개 너머로 날아가는데  Why, oh why can't I? 왜.. 왜 나는 날아갈 수 없을까?  if happy little blue birds fly 행복한 작은 파랑새는  beyond the rainbow 무지개 너머로 날아갈 수 있는데  why, oh why can't I? 왜, 왜 나는 날아갈 수 없을까?"

  Kylie Minogue  ,Beautiful,"I'm losing my way in this night Walking away from the light Surrender will be my escape Breaking the walls of my mind  I'm one step ahead of the truth I hear what I want to hear, and I hear you And if I lie with you long enough, I can see the things I'm dreaming of Let's go through the ritual Until everything is beautiful (Beautiful)  Getting a taste for this high For bending the rules of what's right But fooling myself feels so sweet Reality looks black and white  Pulling the ripcord I dive It's a cardboard kingdom, but it makes me feel, that if I lie with you long enough, I can see the things I'm dreaming of Let's go through the ritual Until everything is beautiful (Beautiful)  And now I'm traveling at such blissful speed No need to think at this velocity The things I feel begin to fade to black Now I've burned my map and I won't go back  So if I lie with you long enough, I can see the things I'm dreaming of Let's go through the ritual Until everything is beautiful (Beautiful)  And if I lie with you long enough, I can see the things I'm dreaming of Let's go through the ritual Until everything is beautiful (Beautiful)"

  Art Garfunkel  ,Why Worry,"Baby, I see this world has made you sad, Some people can be bad The things they do, the things they say. But, baby, I'll wipe away those bitter tears. I'll chase away those restless fears That turn your blue skies into gray. Why Worry? There should be laughter after pain, There should be sunshine after rain, These things have always been the same, So Why Worry, now? Why Worry, now? Baby, when I get down I turn to you, And you make sense of what I do And, no, it isn't hard to say. But, baby, just when this world Seems mean and cold Our love comes shining red and gold And all the rest is by the way. Why Worry? There should be laughter after pain, There should be sunshine after rain, These things have always been the same, So Why Worry, now? Why Worry, now? Why Worry? There should be laughter after pain, There should be sunshine after rain, These things have always been the same, So Why Worry, now? There should be laughter after pain, There should be sunshine after rain, These things have always been the same, So Why Worry, now? Why Worry, now? (Why Worry? Why Worry, now?) (Repeat and Fade)"

  Duffy  ,I`m Scared,"The blank pages of my diary,  That I haven`t touched since you left me,  The closed blinds in my home  See no light of day.  Dust gathers on my stereo  Cos I can`t bare to hear the radio  The piano sits in a shaded space  With a picture of your face.    I`m scared to face another day  Cos the fear in me just won`t go away.  In an instant, you were gone and I`m scared.    Coffee stains on your favorite book  Remind me of you so I can`t even look.  The magazines you left on the floor,      You won`t need them anymore.    A towel left hangin on the wall,  No sign of wet foosteps in the hall  There`s no smell of your sweet cologne.  I`m lying here alone.    I`m scared to face another day  Cos the fear in me just won`t go away.  In an instant, you were gone and now I`m scared.    I`m scared to face another day  Cos the fear in me just won`t go away.  In an instant, you were gone, now I`m scared.  In an instant you were gone and I`m scared"

This time This time This time  I turned your bricks into a wall. I built the throne where you sat tall. I let them praise you like messiah. while I wore your crown of thorns.  I turned your bricks into a wall. I built the throne where you sat tall. I let them praise you like messiah. while I wore your crown of thorns -

  Sting  ,Englishman In New York (Symphonicities Version) (Feat. Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra),"I don't drink coffee I take tea, my dear. I like my toast done on one side. And you can hear it in my accent when I talk, I'm an Englishman in New York.  You see me walking down Fifth Avenue, A walking cane here at my side. I take it everywhere I walk, I'm an Englishman in New York.  Whoa. I'm an alien. I'm a legal alien. I'm an Englishman in New York. Whoa. I'm an alien. I'm a legal alien. I'm an Englishman in New York.  If ""manners maketh man"" as someone said, He's the hero of the day. It takes a man to suffer ignorance and mile. Be yourself no matter what they say.  Whoa. I'm an alien. I'm a legal alien. I'm an Englishman in New York. Whoa. I'm an alien. I'm a legal alien. I'm an Englishman in New York.  Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety, But you could end up as the only one. Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society. At night a candle's brighter than the sun.  Takes more than combat gear to make a man. Takes more than a license for a gun. Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can. A gentleman will walk but never run.  If ""manners maketh man"" as someone said, He's the hero of the day. It takes a man to suffer ignorance and mile. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say. Be yourself no matter what they say."

  Mariah Carey  ,Petals,I've often wondered if there's Ever been a perfect family I've always longed for undividedness And sought stability A flower taught me how to pray But as I grew that flower changed She started failing in the wind Like golden petals scattering And I miss you dandelion And even love you And I wish there was a way For me to trust you But it hurts me every time I try to touch you But I miss you dandelion And even love you I gravitated towards a patriarch So young predictably I was resigned to spend my life With a maze of misery A boy and girl befriended me We're bonded through despondency I stayed so long but finally I fled to save my sanity And I miss you little sis and Little brother And I hope you realize I'll always love you And although you're struggling You will recover And I miss you little sis and Little brother So many I considered Closest to me Turned on a dime and sold me Out dutifully Although that knife was chipping Away at me They turned their eyes away and Went home to sleep And I missed a lot of life But I'll recover Though I know you really like To see me suffer Still I wish that you and I'd Forgive each other 'Cause I miss you Valentine And really loved you I guess I loved you I tried so hard But To preserve my sanity And I found the strength to break away Fly

Shout at the devil

  MGMT  ,Congratulations,Dead in the water It's not a paid vacation The sons and daughters of city officials Attend demonstrations It's hardly a sink or swim When all is well if the ticket sells Out with a whimper It's not a blaze of glory You look down from your temple As people endeavor to make it a story And chisel a marble word But all is lost if it's never heard But I've got someone to make reports That tell me how my money's spent To book my stays and draw my blinds So I can't see what's really there And all I need's a great big congratulations I'll keep your dreams You pay attention for me As strange as it seems I'd rather dissolve than have you ignore me The ground may be moving fast But I tied my boots to a broken mast The difference is clear You throw it in your cauldron Rust and veneer dusk and dawn Steinways and Baldwins You start with a simple stock of all the waste And salt to taste But damn my luck and damn these friends That keep on combing back their smiles I save my grace with half-assed guilt And lay down the quilt upon the lawn Spread my arms and soak up congratulations

  Eric Benet  ,The Last Time,"The first time I fell in love was long ago. I didn't know how to give my love at all. The next time I settled for what felt so close. But without romance, you're never gonna fall. After everything I've learned; Now it's finally my turn. This is the last time I'll fall... in love. The first time we walked under that starry sky, there was a moment when everything was clear. I didn't need to ask or even wonder why, because each question is answered when your near. and I'm wise enough to know when a miracle unfolds, this is the last time i'll fall in love. Now don't hold back, just let me know. Could i be moving much too fast or way too slow. 'Cause all of my life, I've waited for this day. To find that once in a lifetime, this is it, I'll never be the same. You'll never know what it's taken me to say these words. And now that I've said them, they could never be enough. As far as I can see, there's only you and only me. This is the last time I'll fall in love. Last time i'll fall in love. The last time i'll fall... in love."

  Fiona Apple  ,Paper Bag,I was staring at the sky Just looking for a star To pray on or wish on or something like that I was having a sweet fix Of a daydream of a boy Whose reality I knew was a hopeless to be had But then the dove of hope began its downward slope And I believed for a moment That my chances were approaching to be grabbed But as it came down near So did a weary tear I thought it was a bird but it was just a paper bag Hunger hurts and I want him so bad oh it kills Cuz I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up I've gotta fold cuz these hands are too shaky to hold Hunger hurts starving works when it costs too much to love And I went crazy again today Looking for a strand to climb Looking for a little hope Baby said he couldn't stay Wouldn't put his lips to mine And a fail to kiss is a fail to cope I said honey I don't feel so good Don't feel justified Come on put a little love here in my void He said it's all in your head I said so's everything but he didn't get it I thought he was a man but he was just a little boy Hunger hurts and I want him so bad oh it kills Cuz I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up I've gotta fold cuz these hands are too shaky to hold Hunger hurts starving works when it costs too much to love Hunger hurts and I want him so bad oh it kills Cuz I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up I've gotta fold cuz these hands are too shaky to hold Hunger hurts starving works when it costs too much to love Hunger hurts and I want him so bad oh it kills Cuz I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up I've gotta fold cuz these hands are too shaky to hold Hunger hurts starving works when it costs too much to love

  Sharleen Spiteri  ,The Sound Of Silence,"Hello darkness, my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone 'Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people, maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share And no one dare Disturb the sound of silence Fools said I, You do not know Silence like a cancer grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you But my words like silent raindrops fell And echoed In the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made And the sign flashed out its warning In the words that it was forming And the sign said, The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls And whisper'd in the sounds of silence"

  Ed Sheeran  ,Eraser,I was born inside a small town I lost that state of mind Learned to sing inside the lord’s house But stopped at the age of nine I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride And when the world’s against me is when I really come alive And every day that Satan tempts me I try to take it in my stride You know that I’ve got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs I think life has got to the point I know without it’s no fun I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up Instead I look in the mirror questioning what I’ve become Guess it’s a stereotypical day for someone like me Without a nine to five job or a uni degree To be caught up in the trappings of the industry Show me the locked doors I’ll find another use for the key and you’ll see I’m well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me But with that said give me one more I am another one to take the sting away I am happy on my own so here I’ll stay Save your loving arms for a rainy day And I’ll find comfort in my pain eraser I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs I chased the picture perfect life I think they painted it wrong I think that money is the route of all evil and fame is hell Relationships and hearts you fix they break as well And ain’t nobody want to see you down in the dumps Because you’re living your dream and this should be fun Please know that I’m not trying to preach like I’m reverend run I beg you don’t be disappointed with the man I’ve become Conversations with my father on the A14 Age 12 telling me I’ve gotta chase those dreams Now I’m playing for the people dad and they know me With my beaten small guitar wearing the same old jeans Wembley stadium crowds two hundred and forty thou I may have grown up but I hope that Damian’s proud And to the next generation inspiration’s allowed The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now somehow I’m well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me But with that said give me one more I am another one to take the sting away Oh I am happy on my own so here I’ll stay Well save your loving arms for a rainy day And I’ll find comfort in my pain eraser And I’ll find comfort in my pain eraser And I’ll find comfort in my pain eraser Welcome to the new show I guess you know I’ve been away Where I'm heading who knows My heart will stay the same Welcome to the new show I guess you know I’ve been away Where I'm heading who knows My pain eraser And I’ll find comfort in my pain eraser And I’ll find comfort in my pain eraser And I’ll find comfort in my pain eraser And I’ll find comfort in my pain eraser

Oh, I'm sorry that you even care  Break these chains and walk without me.   All our ways were paved with gold  But built upon the sand  And we could climb above the water  And rest upon the land.  It's up to you, you make the choice  For I could stay if you need  For our home, for your heart.

  Josh Groban  ,Vincent,Starry starry night Paint your pallet blue and grey Look out on a summers day With eyes that know the darkness in my soul Shadows on the hills Sketch the trees and daffodils Catch the breeze and the winter chills In colors on the snowy lined land Now I understand What you tried to say to me And how you suffered for your sanity And how you tried to set them free They would not listen They do not know how Perhaps they'll listen now Starry starry night Flaming flowers that brightly blazed Swirling clouds and violet haze Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue Colors changing hue Morning fields of amber grey Whethered faces lined in pain Are soothed beneath the artists' loving hand Now I understand What you tried to say to me And how you suffered for your sanity And how you tried to set them free They would not listen They do not know how Perhaps they'll listen now For they could not love you But still your love was true And when your hope was left inside On that starry starry night You took your life as lovers often do But I could have told you Vincent This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you  Like the strangers that you've met The ragged man in ragged clothes The silver thorn A bloody rose Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow Now I think I know What you tried to say to me And how you suffered for your sanity And how you tried to set them free They were not listening They're not listening still Perhaps they never will

  Noah & The Whale  ,2 Atoms In A Molecule,"Last night I had a dream we were inseparably entwined Like a piece of rope made out of two pieces of vine Held together, holding each other with no one else in mind Like 2 atoms in a molecule inseparably combined  But then I woke from the dream to realise I was alone A tragic event I must admit but let's not be overblown I'm not trying to write a love song just a sad, pathetic moan Maybe I just need a change, maybe I just need a new cologne  Now I look at love like being stabbed in the heart You torture each other from day to day and then one day you part Most of the time it's misery but there's some joy at the start Oh for that I'd say it's worth it, just use a blade that's short and sharp on me  And if love is just a game then how come it's no fun If love is just a game how come I've never won I guess maybe it's possible I might be playing it wrong And that's why every time I roll the dice I always come undone"

My feet had left the ground I was floating to heaven But I could only look down My mind was heavy Running ragged with worst case scenarios Emergency exits and the distance below I woke up so worried that the angels let go  Oh God I'm so tired Of being afraid  What would it feel like To put this baggage down If I'm being honest I'm not sure I'd know how I want to take shelter but I'm ready, ready to fight And somewhere in the middle I feel a little paralyzed- But maybe I'm stronger than I realize  I want to believe No, I choose to believe That I was made to become A sanctuary Fear won't go away But I can keep it at bay And these invisible walls Just might keep us safe With vigilant heart I'll push into the dark But I'll learn to breathe deep And make peace with the stars Is that courage or faith To show up every day To trust that there will be light Always waiting behind Even the darkest of nights  And no matter what Somehow we'll be okay Don't be afraid"

  Jamiroquai  ,Light Years (Half The Man),"""People tell me I'm no good Cos I'm expressin' all my sentiments Now I got to channel all my vehemence For the benefit of my self defence And you can be a do gooder But true sincerity ain't charity It can take a life time to be How you wanna be.  You can be light years Away from serious intention And I thought I knew it all Someday I'd get to turn mankind This way If you don't know you can be light years Away from your true destination. No conscious escalation Until I get with good vibration I'm never gonna get to use that use that earthly power Substitutes Can never take the place of peace of mind Losing all sense of direction.  When you're light years Too far away to turn you back on substitution There is no u-turn on a one way route Goin' up when I learn to love the life I can bite the fruit Now I got sunshine in my life.  Light years Never to return to Babylon See money don't make a man But if you really want you get there anyway you can.  """

  Westlife  ,The Rose,Some say love it is a river That drowns the tender reed Some say love it is a razor That leaves your soul to bleed Some say love it is a hunger An endless aching need I say love it is a flower And you its only seed  It's the heart afraid of breaking That never learns to dance It's the dream afraid of waking That never takes the chance It's the one who won't be taken Who cannot seem to give And the soul afraid of dying That never learns to live  When the night has been too lonely And the road has been too long And you think that love is only For the lucky and the strong Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows Lies the seed that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose

  George Michael  ,They Won`t Go When I Go,No more lying friends Wanting tragic ends Though they do pretend They won't go when I go  All those bleeding hearts With sorrows to impart Were right here from the start And they won't go when I go  And I'll go where I've longed To go so long Away from tears  Gone from painful cries Away from saddened eyes Along with Him I'll bide Because they won't go when I go  Big men feeling small Weak ones standing tall I will watch them fall They won't go when I go  And I'll go where I've longed To go so long Away from tears  Unclean minds mislead the pure The innocent will leave for sure For them there is a resting place People sinning just for fun They will never see the sun For they can never show their faces There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner Who will take more than he will give He ain't hardly gonna give  The greed of man will be Far away from me And my soul will be free They won't go when I go  Since my soul conceived All that I believe The kingdom I will see 'Cause they won't go when I go  When I go where I'll go No one can keep me From my destiny  비참한 종말을 맞이할 위선의 친구들은 더 이상 원하지 않아 그들은 거짓 시늉을 할 뿐 나를 따르지 않을거야  슬픔을 버거워하는 고통스런 마음은 처음부터 바로 여기 존재해왔어 그들은 나를 따르지 않아  내가 원했던 곳으로 갈거야 아주 오래도록... 눈물이 없는 저 먼 곳으로...  고통스런 외침을 떠나 슬픔에 젖은 눈물은 멀리하고 주님과 함께 살겠어 내가 갈 때 그들은 함께 가지 않을 테니까  거물도 소심해질 때가 있고 나약한 사람이 굳건히 버티기도 해 그들이 몰락하는 걸 볼거야 내가 가더라도 그들은 따르지 않을거야  내가 원했던 곳으로 갈거야 아주 오래도록... 눈물이 없는 저 먼 곳으로...  악인(惡人)은 선인(善人)을 오도하고 쉴 곳이 있는 순수한 사람들은 떠나고 말거야 그저 재미로 죄악을 저지르는 사람들은 절대 태양을 볼 수가 없어 얼굴 한번 보인 적이 없는 그들이기에... 아무런 희망도 없고 준 것보다 더 많이 받으려 하는 죄인들에게 내줄 자리는 없어 그들은 절대 베풀려고 하지 않아  탐욕스러운 이는 내게 가까이 올 수 없어 나의 영혼은 자유롭지 하지만 그들은 나를 따라 오지 않을거야  나의 영혼이 나의 믿음을 속였기에 난 하느님의 나라를 택하겠어 그들은 나를 따르지 않을 것이기에...  내가 가야 할 길을 가겠다면 아무도 막을 수 없어 내게 주어진 운명을...

  Nana Mouskouri  ,The Rose,Some say love it is a river That drowns the tender reed Some say love it is a razor That leaves your soul to bleed Some say love it is a hunger An endless aching need I say love it is a flower And you it's only seed It's the heart afraid of breaking That never learns to dance It's the dream afraid of waking That never takes the chance It's the one who won't be taken Who cannot seem to give And the soul afraid of dying That never learns to live When the night has been so lonely And the road has been too long And you think that love is only For the lucky and the strong Just remember in the winter Far beneath the bitter snow Lies the seed that with the sun's love In the spring becomes a rose

And at heart He's full of strangers Dodging on his train of thought Train of thought"

  MARINA  ,Happy,Couldn't relax couldn't sit back And let the sunlight in my lap I sang a hymn to bring me peace And then it came a melody It felt so sweet it felt so strong It made me feel like I belonged And all the sadness inside me Melted away like I was free I found what I'd been looking for in myself Found a life worth living for someone else Never thought that I could be I could be Happy happy Don't go out much at all I've never been the type to call I realize to be happy Maybe I need a little company So now you know you know it all That I've been des-desperately alone I haven't found the one for me But I believe in divinity I found what I'd been looking for in myself Found a life worth living for someone else Never thought that I could be I could be Happy happy I believe in possibility I believe someone's watching over me And finally I have found a way to be Happy happy From the concrete to the coast I was looking for a holy ghost Like the land joining the sea Happiness it followed me I believe in possibility I believe someone's watching over me And finally I have found a way to be Happy happy happy

  Bella Thorne  ,Walk with Me,"I wish I could stand on a star I wish I could be where you are They say, ""don't you ever give up"" It's so hard to be somethin' when you're not  But I have walked alone with the stars in the moonlit night I have walked alone, no one by my side Now I walk with you with my head held high In the darkest sky, I feel so alive  Adrift a lonely, little cloud Above ground where I stand so proud My face glowing loudly through the crowd As I walk with the beauty of the night  But I have walked alone with the stars in the moonlit night I have walked alone, no one by my side Now I walk with you with my head held high In the darkest sky, I feel so alive  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh  But I have walked alone with the stars in the moonlit night I have walked alone, no one by my side Now I walk with you with my head held high In the darkest sky, I feel so alive"
