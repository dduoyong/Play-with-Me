  Boyz II Men  ,Brokenhearted (Soulpower Mix),Lonely brokenhearted Life's not over I can start again While I'm lonely brokenhearted It's a hurting thing to get over I'm young but I'm wise Enough to know that you Don't fall in love overnight That's why I thought if I Took my time that everything In love would be right But as soon as I closed my eyes I was saying to love Goodbye But I guess I'm Lonely brokenhearted Life's not over I can start again While I'm lonely brokenhearted It's a hurting thing to get over No more empty conversation Next time I will be totally sure Don't want the pain of falling In and out of love It's more Than my poor heart should endure So I listen to all the advice And remember each time I cry But I guess I'm Lonely brokenhearted Life's not over I can start again While I'm lonely brokenhearted It's a hurting thing to get over Lonely brokenhearted Life's not over I can start again While I'm lonely brokenhearted It's a hurting thing to get over  so I listen to all the advice And remember each time I cry only brokenhearted Lonely brokenhearted Life's not over I can start again While I'm lonely brokenhearted It's a hurting thing to get over Never gonna be alone again That's why I asked you to be My bestfriend boy you know Your always on my mind Think about ya all the time Lonely brokenhearted It's a hurting thing to get over It's a hurting thing to get over Lonely brokenhearted Life's not over I can start again While I'm lonely brokenhearted

  Floetry  ,My Apology,"Intro: Karma usually comes wearing a stranger’s light; it’s easier to deal with that way. But now it’s you, I’ve hurt you, disrespected you. There’s nowhere to hide, no turning back, no rearrangement. Only what lies ahead…and you’re so heaven sent.  Hook: I know you’re feeling hurt because of what I did to you. If it’s blame I’ll take it maybe we will make it through. ‘Cause I love you, I love you, Think about it baby.  Verse: I’m sorry for giving you the cold shoulder. Never been this wrong before, Never stood my ground and breathed it in before. All I wanted to do is hold ya. Never felt so brave and so afraid before, Never faced alone and felt the peace before. With tears in my eyes I come to you sincerely. Excepting this space I’m in, Growing outta the phase where I just wanna win. You act as though you don’t even hear me. Look at me baby…look at me, I know you.  Hook: I know you’re feeling hurt because of what I did to you. If it’s blame I’ll take it maybe we will make it through. ‘Cause I love you, I love you, Think about it baby.  Verse 2: Growth. I released my grief it was a heavy load, Survived the sleep and now I’m letting go, Waking up and living up to what I had proposed. Woman now. I love the girl I used to be, Ever step she took was reaching out to me, Every breath is blessed responsibility. We made it baby. I can’t control your feelings. (Feel me) I can’t take back, what I’ve done. (With my hand on my heart,) I’m coming to you sincerely, If you hear me. I know you.  Hook: I know you’re feeling hurt because of what I did to you. If it’s blame I’ll take it maybe we will make it through. ‘Cause I love you, I love you, Think about it baby.  Outro: Think about it. We know better. But love has no expectations. So I don’t expect you to do anything. Think about it. This is for me. I’m offering this to you, To free myself. ‘Cause I know what I have to do. This is my apology. Think about it baby."

Of all the miracles, signs and wonders, There's still one mystery, How did you manage to love me? (how did you manage that?) How did you manage to love me?  Said I've got to know how (how did you manage to love?) After all that i have done, oh Lord How? (how did you manage to love?) How could i have been so bad, oh Lord How? (how did you manage to forgive me?) Even when i didnt believe in me you believed in me Lord. How? (how did you manage to forgive me?) Jesus you sacrificed your dear life for me. (How did you manage to forgive me?) Ooooh Lord tell me (why did the pain uprise for me)"

  Eric Benet  ,In the End,I heard some news from a friend of mine Struggling with the woes of life Just broken down as rain kept steady pouring We questioned and we philsophized But the only truth that we surmised Is rain will fall so the rose will keep on growing Sometimes it's hard to understand How fate can deal with such a heavy hand But in the end You're gonna find that strength that lies within And in the end All you need is the comfort of a friend And in the end You won't break cause you're learning how to bend And the hand of God will guide you always In the end Now I know a woman so abused By the hands and words husband used Till the day would come when she could take no more With two little girls she was left to feed She taught them strength and self esteem Now she's an inspiration to everyone she meets I know that life has a funny way of bringing out the best by bringing on the pain But in the end A little love's gonna bring you back again And in the end Every answer's written on the wind And in the end Looking back you can finally understand He was always there beside you You'll see Cause I know the fight when you struggle every morning Just to face that world one more day And you're holding on to life while a northern wind is blowing Just believe your help is on the way on the way Oh in the end You're gonna find that strength that lies within And in the end You're gonna get there no matter where you've been Cause in the end well The one truth is love will always win And the hand of God will guide you Just believe and let Him in Cause in the end well A little love's gonna bring you back again And in the end well Every answer's written on the wind And in the end Just look back and I swear you'll understand He was always there beside you I heard some news from a friend of mine

  The Jackson 5  ,Never Can Say Goodbye,"I Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now. I never can say goodbye.  Even though the pain and heartache seems to follow me wherever I go, Though I try and try to hide my feelings, they always seems to show,  Then you try to say you're leaving me and I always have to say no, tell me why is it so.  That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now. I never can say goodbye.  Everytime I think I've had enough and start heading for the door, There's a very strange vibration piercing me right through the core, It says, ""Turn around, you fool, you know you love him more and more."" Tell me why is it so.  Don't wanna let go. Never can say goodbye. Boy oo oo baby. Never can say goodbye. No no no no no oo. Oh, I never can say goodbye. Boy oo oo.  I never can say goodbye. No no no no no oo. Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now. I never can say goodbye.  I keep thinking that our propblems soon are all gonna work out. But there's that same unhappy feeling, there's that anguish, there's that doubt. It's the same old dizzy hangup, can't do with you or without. Tell me why is it so, don't wanna let you go."

  Anita Baker  ,Fairy Tales,"I can remember stories, those things my mother said. She told me fairytales before I went to bed. She spoke of happy endings and tucked me in real tight. She'd turn my night light on and kiss my face ""good night.""  My mind would fill of visions, of perfect paradise. She told me everything. She said he'd be so nice. He'd ride up on his horse and take me away one night. I'd be so happy with him, we'd ride clean out of sight.  She never said that we would curse, cry, and scream, and lie. She never said that maybe, someday he'd say goodbye. The story ends, as stories do. Reality steps into view. No longer living life in paradise. No fairytales.  Oh,oh,oh  She spoke about happy endings, of stories not like this. She'd say he'd slay all dragons, defeat the evil prince. She'd say he'd come to save me, swim through the stormy sea. I'd understand the story. It would be good for me.  You never came to save me. You let me stand alone. Out in the wilderness, alone in the cold. My story ends. as stories do. Reality steps into view. No longer living life in paradise. No fairytales, yeah!  I don't look for pies up in the sky baby! Need reality now! I said I don't feel the need to be pacified, don't you try, honey I know you lied.  You never came to save me. You let me stand alone. Out in this wilderness, alone in the cold. I found no magic potion, no horse with wings to fly. I found the poisoned apple, my destiny to die.  No royal kiss could save me, no magic spell to spin. My fantasy is over, my life must now begin. My story ends, as stories do. Reality steps into view. No longer living life in paradise. No fairytales.  Oh, oh, oh"

  Aretha Franklin  ,My Way,"And now the end is near And so I face the final curtain My friend I'll say it clear I'll state my case of which I'm certain  I've lived a life that's full I traveled each and every highway And more, much more than this I did it my way  Regrets I've had a few But then again too few to mention I did what I had to do And saw it through without exemption  I planned each charted course Each careful step along the byway And more, much more than this I did it my way  Yes there were times I'm sure you knew When I bit off more than I could chew But through it all when there was doubt I ate it up and spit it out, I faced it all And I stood tall and did it my way  I've loved, I've laughed and cried I've had my fill, my share of losing And now as tears subside I find it all so amusing  To think I did all that And may I say not in a shy way Oh no, oh no, not me I did it my way  For what is a man what has he got If not himself then he has not To say the things he truly feels And not the words of one who kneels The record shows I took the blows And did it my way  Yes it was my way"

Sorry if I sound So filled with gloom You say you care And I know you do But this is From my experience And my conclusion Only makes sense  Just cause I love you And you love me It doesn't mean That we're meant to be I can climb mountains Swim cross the seas But the most Frightening thing You and me  Most circumstances I know my fate But in this love thang I don't get the game Why does it feel Like those who give in They only wind up Losing a friend  Just cause I love you And you love me It doesn't mean That we'll ever be Fly cross the ocean Sing for the queen But the most Frightening thing Is you and me  I'm sure though I'm not sure But if we never try We'll never know It's better to have loved Then not to loved at all  Not trying is worse Than to stumble and fall And if we do I'd rather it be with you Cause at least there Will be sweet memories Oh, I'm not scared"

  Stevie Wonder  ,You Will Know (Album Ver.),Lonely one of young so brokenhearted Travelling down the rigid road of life Using pharmaceutical extractions To find the paradise  Finds the high but comes down feeling lower Gets down on their knees and starts to pray Looking up to heaven for the answer They hear a voice that says  You will know Troubled heart you'll know Problems have solutions Trust and I will show  You will know Troubled heart you'll know Every life has reason For I made it so  Single parent trying to raise their children But they would much rather not alone Reaches out to find that special someone To make their house a home  Finds someone but no one is the right one Gets down on their knees and starts to pray Looking up to heaven for the answer They hear a voice that says  You will know Troubled heart you'll know Problems have solutions Trust and I will show  You will know Troubled heart you'll know Every life has reason For I made it so  (Repeat 1st e 2nd chorus)

  Bobby Womack  ,Across 110th Street,"I was the third brother of five, Doing whatever I had to do to survive. I'm not saying what I did was alright, Trying to break out of the ghetto was a day to day fight. Been down so long, getting up didn't cross my mind, I knew there was a better way of life that I was just trying to find. You don't know what you'll do until you're put under pressure, Across 110th Street is a hell of a tester.  Across 110th Street, Pimps trying to catch a woman that's weak Across 110th Street, Pushers won't let the junkie go free. Across 110th Street, Woman trying to catch a trick on the street. Across 110th Street, You can find it all in the street.  I got one more thing I'd like to y'all about right now. Hey brother, there's a better way out. Snorting that coke, shooting that dope man you're copping out. Take my advice, it's either live or die. You've got to be strong, if you want to survive.  The family on the other side of town, Would catch hell without a ghetto around. In every city you find the same thing going down, Harlem is the capital of every ghetto town.

  Aretha Franklin  ,What A Friend We Have In Jesus,"What a friend we have in Jesus All our sins and griefs to bear What a privilege to carry Everything to God in prayer Oh what peace we often forfeit Oh what needless pain we bear All because we do not carry Everything to God in prayer  Have we trials and temptations Is there trouble anywhere We should never be discouraged Take it to the Lord in prayer Can we find a friend so faithful Who will all our sorrows share Jesus knows our every weakness Take it to the Lord in prayer  Are we weak and heavy laden Cumbered with a load of care Precious Savior, still our refuge Take it to the Lord in prayer Do thy friends despise, forsake thee Take it to the Lord in prayer In his arms he'll take and shield thee Thou wilt find a solace there"

Ooh, we cut up our old jeans and go outside.  Neighbor's always smiling with the baby on her knee. Mia's sat on the front step getting her hair combed out in weaves. And music, the bass boomin' oh it's from the car parked in the street. Got that new song on repeat, oh oh  [Chorus] I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you I'd, I'd like to paint a picture for you Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from. I'd just like to make me see that I desire the simple things.  Growing up, we didn't have a lot of money. Used to spend our summer having parties on the drive. Plastic cups for rum and punch, eating chicken that's hot and sweet. All the women discussing what love is like, ooh you know the way I mean. And I'm just sitting, watching, hoping the boys will call for me. Got that new song on repeat, oh oh  [Chorus] I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you I'd, I'd like to paint a picture for you Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from. I'm just trying to make you see that I desire the simple things.  Maybe then, now and then I would want somebody. Delicate intimate, used to dream of someone to love. Now you come and you go right by me. Now I know I'm in love.  [Chorus] I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you I'd, I'd like to paint this picture for you Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from I'm just trying to make you see that I desire the simple things.

  PREP  ,Futures,Back against the wall There goes the floor beneath my feet A stack of empty crates Giving out under me I'll take one more sleepless night Then book the cheapest flight Buy my head some space to clear It's no time to cut and run But I can't think about what I've done To get me here Two miles off the ground with no clouds to be seen Give me some air that's cold and clean Love can't bring me down when I've taken myself Way out of reach Weakest move but falls But you know this hope is on the side Trying to split the change Into numbers that don't divide I'll take one more sleepless night Then I'm on the cheapest flight Give my head a chance to clear It's no time to cut and run But I can't think about what I've done To get me here Two miles off the ground with no clouds to be seen Give me some air that's cold and clean Love can't bring me down when I've taken myself Way out of reach Two miles off the ground with no clouds to be seen Give me some air that's cold and clean Love can't bring me down when I've taken myself Way out of reach Two miles off the ground with no clouds to be seen Give me some air that's cold and clean Love can't bring me down when I've taken myself Way out of reach

  Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell  ,If I Could Build My Whole World Around You,"(boy) if I could build my whole world around you, Darling, first I'd put heaven by your side. Pretty flowers would grow where ever you walk, honey, And over your head would be the bluest sky. Then I'd take ev'ry drop of rain, and wash all your troubles away. I'd have the whole world wrapped up in you, darling, And that would be alright.  (girl) if I could build my whole world around you, I'd make your eyes the morning sun. I'd put so much love where there is sorrow, I'd put joy where there's never been none. Then I'd give my love to you, For you to keep for the rest of your life. And happiness would surely be ours, And that would be alright.  (boy) if I could build my whole world around you, I'd give you the greatest gift any woman could possess.  (girl) and I'd step into this world you created, And give you a true love and tenderness. And there'd be something new with ev'ry tomorrow To make this world better as days go by.  (boy) that is if I could build my whole world around you. (girl) if I could build my whole world around you, (both) that would be all right. oh yeah  (boy) that is if I could build my whole world around you.

But the sun’s too hot / it’s much too hot. / And as though it were all planned / our wings begin to fall apart. / But the sun’s too hot / it’s much too hot. / And we fall / one by one until there’s none. The sun still shines eternally / as it had done before. / And it shines / and it smiles / and it laughs forever more. And it our minds the skies were ours to seize. / The waters ours to drink / and the air for us to breathe. / But they belong to the stars and the sun / and their open invitation / was just a game for fun.

  Alberta Hunter  ,My Handy Man Ain't Handy No More,"Now whoever said a good man is hard to find Positively absolutely sure was blind Cause I just found the best man that ever was And here’s just a few of the things that he does.  He shakes my ashes, Greases my griddle, Churns my butter, And he strokes my fiddle, My man, is such a handy man.  Now he threads my needle, And he creams my wheat, Heats my heater, And he chops my meat (he’s a mess), My man, is such a handy man.  Now I don’t care if you believe it or not, He’s a mighty nice man to have around, Cause when my furnace gets too hot, He’s right there to turn my damper down, For everything, that man of mine’s got a scheme And honey it’s amazing the way he handles my machine My man, is such a handyman (oh that man is a mess).  He flaps my flapjacks, Cleans off the table, Feeds the horses in my stable, My man, is such a handyman.  And do you know, sometimes he’s up way before dawn, Busy cleaning the rough edges off my lawn, My man, is such a handyman.  Now, he never has a single word to say, While he’s working hard (poor soul), And I’d give anything if you could see the way, he handles my front yard.  Now my ice never gets a chance to melt away, Cause he sees that I get a nice fresh piece everyday, My man, is such a handyman."

  Dusty Springfield  ,The Windmills Of Your Mind,Round like a circle in a spiral like a wheel within a wheel Never ending on beginning on an ever spinning reel Like a snowball down a mountain or a carnival balloon Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes on its face And the world is like an apple spinning silently in space Like the circles that you find In the windmills of your mind Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream Like the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes on its face And the world is like an apple spinning silently in space Like the circles that you find In the windmills of your mind Keys that jingle in your pocket Words that jangle in your head Why did summer go so quickly Was it something that you said Lovers walk along a shore And leave their footprints in the sand Was the sound of distant drumming Just the fingers of your hand Pictures hanging in a hallway Or the fragment of a song Half remembered names and faces But to whom do they belong When you knew that it was over you Were suddenly aware That the autumn leaves were turning To the color of her hair Like a circle in a spiral Like a wheel within a wheel Never ending on beginning on an ever spinning reel As the images unwind Like the circles that you find In the windmills of your mind
