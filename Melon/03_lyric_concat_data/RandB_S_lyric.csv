  Sam Ock  ,Rollercoaster,I wish i could say that I'm a honest human being but what you're really seeing is the truth but times go and change I really don't know what I'm feeling the one thing that I know is that I'm with you I know there's pain 'cause life it ain't so easy and people go and leave you all alone and I can't complain I've been blessed with many things and in the end I know that I'll be home i'll go home let the bad times roll 'cause I'm with you and you're with me let the bad times roll 'cause we're together and that's all that matters to me and I gotta say fellowship in pain is a kind that never fades away which is why i don't fight it I let it come the peace I receive when it's over is a different one from the lack of better words it's intimate a bad time will show me all my pride and it'll murder me you've heard of it right the sound of a soul cry so much louder when there's someone else by its side so my brothers and my sisters when you see it coming the wave of pain stand firm stop your running I think we all agree that it can't be stopped but if we all hold our breath then how can we not share in this connection this empathy so much stronger than our good times though anything personally I think that it's a better day when the light shines and i see the darkness run away let the bad times roll 'cause I'm with you and you're with me let the bad times roll 'cause we're together and that's all that matters to me sometimes they say about the things you're keeping you don't know what you got until it's gone but i'm here to stay of course until i'm leaving 'til life it calls it quits and then i fall i know there's a way to eternity in heaven for i will say that jesus is my truth a smile on my face yes that's what i'll be keeping when all is through ill come home back to you i'll come home back to you let the bad times roll 'cause I'm with you and you're with me let the bad times roll 'cause we're together and that's all that matters to me
  dvsn  ,Can`t Wait,"Perfect timing, something unpredictable You remind me, of someone that I never know  And nobody wants you like I do Nobody feels you like I could Nobody sees you quite the way I do, way I do And nobody treats you like I would And we both know that  Life's too short, let's not waste Any time, we can wait Cause we might find, that there's no time Cause life's too short  There's some situations that turn into relationships, damn Too impatient, I can't sit back and wait for it  Cause nobody wants you like I do Nobody feels you like I could Nobody sees you quite the way I do, way I do And nobody treats you like I would And we both know that  Life's too short, let's not waste Any time, we can wait Cause we might find, that there's no time Cause life's too short You know that Life's too short, let's not waste Any time, we can wait Cause we might find, that there's no time Cause life's too short"
  Alberta Hunter  ,My Handy Man Ain't Handy No More,"Now whoever said a good man is hard to find Positively absolutely sure was blind Cause I just found the best man that ever was And here’s just a few of the things that he does.  He shakes my ashes, Greases my griddle, Churns my butter, And he strokes my fiddle, My man, is such a handy man.  Now he threads my needle, And he creams my wheat, Heats my heater, And he chops my meat (he’s a mess), My man, is such a handy man.  Now I don’t care if you believe it or not, He’s a mighty nice man to have around, Cause when my furnace gets too hot, He’s right there to turn my damper down, For everything, that man of mine’s got a scheme And honey it’s amazing the way he handles my machine My man, is such a handyman (oh that man is a mess).  He flaps my flapjacks, Cleans off the table, Feeds the horses in my stable, My man, is such a handyman.  And do you know, sometimes he’s up way before dawn, Busy cleaning the rough edges off my lawn, My man, is such a handyman.  Now, he never has a single word to say, While he’s working hard (poor soul), And I’d give anything if you could see the way, he handles my front yard.  Now my ice never gets a chance to melt away, Cause he sees that I get a nice fresh piece everyday, My man, is such a handyman."

  Aretha Franklin  ,What A Friend We Have In Jesus,"What a friend we have in Jesus All our sins and griefs to bear What a privilege to carry Everything to God in prayer Oh what peace we often forfeit Oh what needless pain we bear All because we do not carry Everything to God in prayer  Have we trials and temptations Is there trouble anywhere We should never be discouraged Take it to the Lord in prayer Can we find a friend so faithful Who will all our sorrows share Jesus knows our every weakness Take it to the Lord in prayer  Are we weak and heavy laden Cumbered with a load of care Precious Savior, still our refuge Take it to the Lord in prayer Do thy friends despise, forsake thee Take it to the Lord in prayer In his arms he'll take and shield thee Thou wilt find a solace there"

  Dusty Springfield  ,The Windmills Of Your Mind,Round like a circle in a spiral like a wheel within a wheel Never ending on beginning on an ever spinning reel Like a snowball down a mountain or a carnival balloon Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes on its face And the world is like an apple spinning silently in space Like the circles that you find In the windmills of your mind Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream Like the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes on its face And the world is like an apple spinning silently in space Like the circles that you find In the windmills of your mind Keys that jingle in your pocket Words that jangle in your head Why did summer go so quickly Was it something that you said Lovers walk along a shore And leave their footprints in the sand Was the sound of distant drumming Just the fingers of your hand Pictures hanging in a hallway Or the fragment of a song Half remembered names and faces But to whom do they belong When you knew that it was over you Were suddenly aware That the autumn leaves were turning To the color of her hair Like a circle in a spiral Like a wheel within a wheel Never ending on beginning on an ever spinning reel As the images unwind Like the circles that you find In the windmills of your mind

Like a waterfall Like a waterfall...... 부서진 사람  우릴 위해 할 수 있는 게 아무것도 없다는 게...... 작고 약한 나의 사랑을 괴롭혀요. 이제 더는 아무런 힘도 갖지 못한 추억 앞에...... 인형처럼 웅크려 앉아 울고 있죠  그래요. 꿈처럼 짧아도 마지막이 슬퍼도.. 한때나마 난 행복했죠. 추억만은 남겨줬으니......  Like a waterfall...... Like a waterfall...... Like a waterfall...... 내게 다가와 Like a waterfall...... Like a waterfall...... Like a waterfall...... 부서진 사람  추억만은 남겨줬으니깐

  Corinne Bailey Rae  ,I`d Like To (Weekender Mix),"Lying here with you reminds me of those days. Me and Candice waking up to a heat wave. Mother's in the garden inviting everyone. Ooh, we cut up our old jeans and go outside.  Neighbor's always smiling with the baby on her knee. Mia's sat on the front step getting her hair combed out in weaves. And music, the bass boomin' oh it's from the car parked in the street. Got that new song on repeat, oh oh  [Chorus] I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you I'd, I'd like to paint a picture for you Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from. I'd just like to make me see that I desire the simple things.  Growing up, we didn't have a lot of money. Used to spend our summer having parties on the drive. Plastic cups for rum and punch, eating chicken that's hot and sweet. All the women discussing what love is like, ooh you know the way I mean. And I'm just sitting, watching, hoping the boys will call for me. Got that new song on repeat, oh oh  [Chorus] I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you I'd, I'd like to paint a picture for you Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from. I'm just trying to make you see that I desire the simple things.  Maybe then, now and then I would want somebody. Delicate intimate, used to dream of someone to love. Now you come and you go right by me. Now I know I'm in love.  [Chorus] I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you I'd, I'd like to paint this picture for you Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from I'm just trying to make you see that I desire the simple things.

  Stevie Wonder  ,I Wish,Looking back on when I Was a little nappy headed boy Then my only worry Was for Christmas what would be my toy Even though we sometimes Would not get a thing We were happy with the Joy the day would bring Sneaking out the back door To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine Greeted at the back door With boy thought I told you not to go outside Tryin' your best to bring the Water to your eyes Thinkin' it might stop her Grom woopin' your behind I wish those days could come back once more Why did those days ever have to go I wish those days could come back once more Why did those days ever have to go Cause I love them so  Brother says he's tellin' 'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl Just don't tell I'll give you Anything you want in this whole wide world Mama gives you money for Sunday school You trade yours for candy after church is through Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall you nasty boy Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the wall You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right But while you were doin'it it sure felt outta sight I wish those days could come back once more Why did those days ever have to go I wish those days could come back once more Why did those days ever have to go
  PREP  ,Futures,Back against the wall There goes the floor beneath my feet A stack of empty crates Giving out under me I'll take one more sleepless night Then book the cheapest flight Buy my head some space to clear It's no time to cut and run But I can't think about what I've done To get me here Two miles off the ground with no clouds to be seen Give me some air that's cold and clean Love can't bring me down when I've taken myself Way out of reach Weakest move but falls But you know this hope is on the side Trying to split the change Into numbers that don't divide I'll take one more sleepless night Then I'm on the cheapest flight Give my head a chance to clear It's no time to cut and run But I can't think about what I've done To get me here Two miles off the ground with no clouds to be seen Give me some air that's cold and clean Love can't bring me down when I've taken myself Way out of reach Two miles off the ground with no clouds to be seen Give me some air that's cold and clean Love can't bring me down when I've taken myself Way out of reach Two miles off the ground with no clouds to be seen Give me some air that's cold and clean Love can't bring me down when I've taken myself Way out of reach
