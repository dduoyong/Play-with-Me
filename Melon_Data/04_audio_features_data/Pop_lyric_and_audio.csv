  Duffy  ,I`m Scared,"The blank pages of my diary,  That I haven`t touched since you left me,  The closed blinds in my home  See no light of day.  Dust gathers on my stereo  Cos I can`t bare to hear the radio  The piano sits in a shaded space  With a picture of your face.    I`m scared to face another day  Cos the fear in me just won`t go away.  In an instant, you were gone and I`m scared.    Coffee stains on your favorite book  Remind me of you so I can`t even look.  The magazines you left on the floor,      You won`t need them anymore.    A towel left hangin on the wall,  No sign of wet foosteps in the hall  There`s no smell of your sweet cologne.  I`m lying here alone.    I`m scared to face another day  Cos the fear in me just won`t go away.  In an instant, you were gone and now I`m scared.    I`m scared to face another day  Cos the fear in me just won`t go away.  In an instant, you were gone, now I`m scared.

You're a hold out Well I'm a hold out too But it took me all this time to figure out Something you already knew Will love be true? Can it pull you through? How long? How strong? Somethings depend on you See I always figured I was going to meet somebody here and I don't know why Why should love come down and suddenly just sweep me away I want to fly But there are so many things in my way  Anyway... I guess you wouldn't know unless I told you But... I love you Well just look at yourself What else would I do?  Hold on",6tSUpwyz4fg19lWxSniZYz,0.453,0.463,-8.767,1,0.651,0.396,142.287
