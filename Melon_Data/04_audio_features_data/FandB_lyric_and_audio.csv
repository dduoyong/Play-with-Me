  Angelo De Augustine  ,Effervescent Island,Up with the morning light Covered in calico Aw You've been so tired leading my whole life Everyone was talking with Something supernatural The ephemeral light's messing up your mind The ephemeral light's taken up your time  [Verse 2] You've been away for years Now you're in view again All we really care for is To see things shine But in the future it's Harder to feel divine Effervescent islands floating in the night Genuine representation of our life  [Chorus] Hate has faded Love is on the rise Slow like everyone's talking Left you hypnotized Entranced and stupefied  [Verse 3] Down with the evening moon Pacing the avenue All of you is searching to feel so fine You were afraid but now you don't seem to mind Anything to touch the silence one more time Anything to feel the love we all shall find  [Chorus] Hate has faded Love is on the rise Slow like everyone's talking Left you paralyzed Inside infinite minds,6uTkZOWbtT0XOmvhoqYt1g,0.428,0.0285,-28.7,1,0.994,0.33,81.516

  Simon & Garfunkel  ,The Sound Of Silence,Hello darkness my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone 'Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share And no one dare Disturb the sound of silence Fools said I You do not know silence like a cancer grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you But my words like silent raindrops fell and echoed In the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made And the sign flashed out its warning In the words that it was forming And the sign said The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls And whispered in the sound of silence,3YfS47QufnLDFA71FUsgCM,0.535,0.225,-13.865,1,0.869,0.338,107.384

Just me and you Through low light and trees A future unseen is a future i can believe  Through the coldest months i held onto A dying hope that flickered in you And we'll start something new further than you As death is to birth The moon to the earth Find a future i can believe  Can you hold me like you held someone you shouldn't have let go? Can you keep me deep inside like the regrets that burnt a hole? Can you love me like you loved someone you loved so long ago?  Take me far away, a late night drive See headlights flash in a stranger's eyes And i'll start something new Just me and you Through low light and trees A future unseen is a future i can believe  Can you hold me like you held someone you shouldn't have let go?

  Leonard Cohen  ,Chelsea Hotel #2,"Chelsea Hotel #2 I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel, you were talking so brave and so sweet, giving me head on the unmade bed, while the limousines wait in the street. Those were the reasons and that was New York, we were running for the money and the flesh. And that was called love for the workers in song probably still is for those of them left. Ah but you got away, didn't you babe, you just turned your back on the crowd, you got away, I never once heard you say, I need you, I don't need you, I need you, I don't need you and all of that jiving around.  I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel you were famous, your heart was a legend. You told me again you preferred handsome men but for me you would make an exception. And clenching your fist for the ones like us who are oppressed by the figures of beauty, you fixed yourself, you said, ""Well never mind, we are ugly but we have the music.""  And then you got away, didn't you babe...  I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best, I can't keep track of each fallen robin. I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel, that's all, I don't even think of you that often.

I don't drink like everybody else,  I do it to forgetting things about myself,  I'm stumbling forward from the spin I've got,  My minds with you but my hearts just not.    So am I close to you anymore, if it's over,  And there's no chance that we'll work it out,  That's why you and I ended over UNI  And I said that's fine, but your the only one that knows I lied  You and I ended over UNI  And I said that's fine, but your the only one that knows I lied    Everybody said that we'll be together forever but I know that,  I never wanna settle down, come around, break up the love like lego now,  Never wanna turn into another like you,  Sleep with my thoughts. dance with my views,  Everythings great but everythings short,  But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus,  Now I'm in position to be another stalker and every thing I say seems to always sound akward,  Like our last kiss it was perfect, we were nervous,  On the surface,  And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it,  Pain is only relevent if it still hurts,  I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative and go back to the day we fell inlove,  Just on our first kiss.    So am I close to you anymore, if it's over  And there's no chance that we'll work it out  That's why you and I ended over UNI  And I said that's fine, but your the only one that knows I lied  You and I ended over UNI  And I said that's fine, but your the only one that knows I lied    Because, if I was gonna go somewhere, I'd be there by now,  And maybe I can let myself down,  And thinking that I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground, keep looking around, to make sure I'm not, the only one to feel low,  Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered, from all that I've done wrong  And I know you'll say, that I'm the only one  But I know God made another one of me to love you better than I ever will    'Cause you and I ended over UNI  and I said that's fine but your the only one who knows that I lied  You and I ended over UNI  And I said that's fine but your the only one who knows that I lied",5Ukzlujip1Slqka5OY82YS,0.422,0.405,-11.126,1,0.323,0.578,74.13

Let me see your beauty broken down like you would do for one you love.

And everything depends upon how near you sleep to me Just take this longing from my tongue all the lonely things my hands have done. Let me see your beauty broken down like you would do for one your love. Hungry as an archway through which the troops have passed, I stand in ruins behind you, with your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps. I love to see you naked over there especially from the back. Oh take this longing from my tongue, all the useless things my hands have done, untie for me your hired blue gown, like you would do for one that you love. You're faithful to the better man, I'm afraid that he left. So let me judge your love affair in this very room where I have sentenced mine to death. I'll even wear these old laurel leaves that he's shaken from his head. Just take this longing from my tongue, all the useless things my hands have done, let me see your beauty broken down, like you would do for one you love.

  Bob Dylan  ,Hurricane,Pistols shots ring out in the barroom night Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall She sees the bartender in a pool of blood Cries out My God they killed them all Here comes the story of the Hurricane The man the authorities came to blame For something that he never done Put him in a prison cell but one time he could a been The champion of the world  Three bodies lying there does Patty see And another man named Bello moving around mysteriously I didn't do it he says and he throws up his hands I was only robbing the register I hope you understand I saw them leaving he says and he stops One of us had better call up the cops And so Patty calls the cops And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing In the hot New Jersey night  Meanwhile far away in another part of town Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around Number one contender for the middleweight crown Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road Just like the time before and the time before that In Patterson that's just the way things go If you're black you might as well not shown up on the street 'Less you wanna draw the heat  Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the corps Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around He said I saw two men running out they looked like middleweights They jumped into a white car with out of state plates And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head Cop said Wait a minute boys this one's not dead So they took him to the infirmary And though this man could hardly see They told him that he could identify the guilty men  Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye Says Wha'd you bring him in here for He ain't the guy Yes here comes the story of the Hurricane The man the authorities came to blame For something that he never done Put in a prison cell but one time he could a been The champion of the world  Four months later the ghettos are in flame Rubin's in South America fighting for his name While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game And the cops are putting the screws to him looking for somebody to blame Remember that murder that happened in a bar Remember you said you saw the getaway car You think you'd like to play ball with the law Think it might a been that fighter you saw running that night Don't forget that you are white  Arthur Dexter Bradley said I'm really not sure Cops said A boy like you could use a break We got you for the motel job and we're talking to your friend Bello Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail be a nice fellow You'll be doing society a favor That sonofabitch is brave and getting braver We want to put his ass in stir We want to pin this triple murder on him He ain't no Gentleman Jim  Rubin could take a man out with just one punch But he never did like to talk about it all that much It's my work he'd say and I do it for pay And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way Up to some paradise Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice And ride a horse along a trail But then they took him to the jailhouse Where they try to turn a man into a mouse  All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance The trial was a pig circus he never had a chance The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger No one doubted that he pulled the trigger And though they could not produce the gun The DA said he was the one who did the deed And the all white jury agreed  Rubin Carter was falsely tried The crime was murder 'one' guess who testified Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied And the newspapers they all went along for the ride How can the life of such a man Be in the palm of some fool's hand To see him obviously framed Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land Where justice is a game  Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten foot cell An innocent man in a living hell That's the story of the Hurricane But it won't be over till they clear his name And give him back the time he's done Put him in a prison cell but one time he could a been The champion of the world,1lqMLr9Wj7SM2F9AikGcxN,0.509,0.827,-7.715,1,0.0409,0.743,135.601

We live in a political world, Wisdom is thrown into jail, It rots in a cell, is misguided as hell, Leaving no one to pick up a trail.  We live in a political world Where mercy walks the plank, Life is in mirrors, death disappears Up the steps into the nearest bank.  We live in a political world Where courage is a thing of the past, Houses are haunted, children are unwanted, The next day could be your last.  We live in a political world, The one we can see and can feel, But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck, We all know for sure that it's real.  We live in a political world, In the cities of lonesome fear, Little by little you turn in the middle But you're never sure why you're here.  We live in a political world, Under the microscope, You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there, You always got more than enough rope.  We live in a political world, Turning and a-thrashing about, As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take, What looks like the easy way out.  We live in a political world, Where peace is not welcome at all, It's turned away from the door to wander some more, Or put up against the wall.  We live in a political world, Everything is hers or his, Climb into the frame and shout God's name, But you're never sure what it is.",1512aL09grQ5uTesJB3GOi,0.637,0.954,-9.289,0,0.0372,0.49,100.536

Well morning comes and you're still with her And the bus and the tourists are gone And you've thrown away the choice and lost your ticket So you have to stay on But the drum-beat strains of the night remain In the rhythm of the new-born day You know sometime you're bound to leave her But for now you're going to stay In the year of the cat.",2NQhQlcVAcDRN3jf6FDTlm,0.548,0.539,-10.56,0,0.0329,0.586,117.092
