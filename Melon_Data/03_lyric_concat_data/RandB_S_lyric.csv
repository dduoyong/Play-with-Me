But now it’s you, I’ve hurt you, disrespected you. There’s nowhere to hide, no turning back, no rearrangement. Only what lies ahead…and you’re so heaven sent.  Hook: I know you’re feeling hurt because of what I did to you. If it’s blame I’ll take it maybe we will make it through. ‘Cause I love you, I love you, Think about it baby.  Verse: I’m sorry for giving you the cold shoulder. Never been this wrong before, Never stood my ground and breathed it in before. All I wanted to do is hold ya. Never felt so brave and so afraid before, Never faced alone and felt the peace before. With tears in my eyes I come to you sincerely. Excepting this space I’m in, Growing outta the phase where I just wanna win. You act as though you don’t even hear me. Look at me baby…look at me, I know you.  Hook: I know you’re feeling hurt because of what I did to you. If it’s blame I’ll take it maybe we will make it through. ‘Cause I love you, I love you, Think about it baby.  Verse 2: Growth. I released my grief it was a heavy load, Survived the sleep and now I’m letting go, Waking up and living up to what I had proposed. Woman now. I love the girl I used to be, Ever step she took was reaching out to me, Every breath is blessed responsibility. We made it baby. I can’t control your feelings. (Feel me) I can’t take back, what I’ve done. (With my hand on my heart,) I’m coming to you sincerely, If you hear me. I know you.  Hook: I know you’re feeling hurt because of what I did to you. If it’s blame I’ll take it maybe we will make it through. ‘Cause I love you, I love you, Think about it baby.  Outro: Think about it. We know better. But love has no expectations. So I don’t expect you to do anything. Think about it. This is for me. I’m offering this to you, To free myself. ‘Cause I know what I have to do. This is my apology. Think about it baby."

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now. I never can say goodbye.  Everytime I think I've had enough and start heading for the door, There's a very strange vibration piercing me right through the core, It says, ""Turn around, you fool, you know you love him more and more."" Tell me why is it so.  Don't wanna let go. Never can say goodbye. Boy oo oo baby. Never can say goodbye. No no no no no oo. Oh, I never can say goodbye. Boy oo oo.  I never can say goodbye. No no no no no oo. Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now. I never can say goodbye.  I keep thinking that our propblems soon are all gonna work out. But there's that same unhappy feeling, there's that anguish, there's that doubt. It's the same old dizzy hangup, can't do with you or without. Tell me why is it so, don't wanna let you go."

My mind would fill of visions, of perfect paradise. She told me everything. She said he'd be so nice. He'd ride up on his horse and take me away one night. I'd be so happy with him, we'd ride clean out of sight.  She never said that we would curse, cry, and scream, and lie. She never said that maybe, someday he'd say goodbye. The story ends, as stories do. Reality steps into view. No longer living life in paradise. No fairytales.  Oh,oh,oh  She spoke about happy endings, of stories not like this. She'd say he'd slay all dragons, defeat the evil prince. She'd say he'd come to save me, swim through the stormy sea. I'd understand the story. It would be good for me.  You never came to save me. You let me stand alone. Out in the wilderness, alone in the cold. My story ends. as stories do. Reality steps into view. No longer living life in paradise. No fairytales, yeah!
